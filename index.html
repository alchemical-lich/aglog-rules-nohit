<h1 id="character-creation"><strong>CHARACTER CREATION</strong></h1>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Select your <strong>Ancestry</strong>. Choose or
roll your PC’s traits, such as their physique, face, skin, hair, speech,
clothing, virtue, vice, and alignment using the tables below. Choose a
name for your PC.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Player Characters (PCs) have four regular
abilities: <strong>Strength</strong> (STR), <strong>Dexterity</strong>
(DEX), <strong>Wits</strong> (WIT), and <strong>Personality</strong>
(PER). Each ability has a bonus value. For the quickest character
creation, simply distribute the following bonuses however you like:</p>
<p><strong>+2</strong>, <strong>+1</strong>, <strong>+1</strong>,
<strong>+0</strong></p>
<p>Optionally, you can randomly generate your bonuses with the
<strong>Random Ability Bonus Table</strong>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><strong>2D6</strong></th>
<th style="text-align: center;"><strong>RANDOM ABILITY
BONUS</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2–3</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">+0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4–7</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">+1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>8–10</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">+2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>11–12</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">+3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the standard array provides the same average ability bonus
at no risk, but also offers no chance of a +3 starting bonus.</p>
<p>The fifth attribute is <strong>Luck</strong>. At level 0, each PC has
a D3 of Luck. A PC can permanently burn a point of luck to re-roll a
<strong>Save</strong>. Luck is gained at the GMs discretion, but
typically at the end of an adventure or for heroic and daring
actions.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Pick or roll for a <strong>Profession</strong>.
This describes your broad area of expertise before you started
adventuring.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Select your first Character Class Template.
Templates grant you a number of special abilities and skills. At levels
2, 3, and 4, choose an additional template from any class, always
starting with <strong>Template A</strong>, following the <strong>Base
Adventurer</strong> Table. At levels 8 and 10 you receive Bonus
Templates (you still have to start at Template A for each new
class).</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> PCs start with a random assortment of
<strong>Gear</strong>, possibly some coin. See the tables below for
Gear. Your Character Class will also give you some starting
equipment.</p>
<p><strong>6</strong>. Note your starting Hit Points
(<strong>HP</strong>) and armor value (<strong>AV</strong>).</p>
<p>HP is your <strong>CON Bonus</strong> modified by your level, as
indicated on the <strong>Base Adventurer</strong> table below. HP is
explained in the Core Rule Section.</p>
<p><strong>AV</strong> is a form of damage reduction. Combat is
explained in the Core Rules Section. If a PC is not wearing armor, their
base <strong>AV</strong> is 0.</p>

<h1 id="core-rules"><strong>CORE RULES</strong></h1>
<h2 id="playing-the-game">Playing the Game</h2>
<h3 id="abilities">Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength (STR)</strong>: Used for melee attacks and saves
requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, or leaping a
chasm. Also used to resist poison, sickness and cold.</li>
<li><strong>Dexterity (DEX)</strong>: Used for ranged attacks, delicate
tasks, moving silently, and saves requiring poise, speed, and
reflexes.</li>
<li><strong>Wits (WIT)</strong>: Used for saves requiring perception,
recalling obscure knowledge, for saves requiring concentration and
precision; such as wielding magic, deductive reasoning, logic,
cleverness, and wisdom.</li>
<li><strong>Personality (PER)</strong>: Used for saves to persuade,
deceive, interrogate, charm, provoke, or read a person. Also used to
resist magic through sheer willpower. Added to Reaction Rolls. PCs may
employ a number of retainers equal to 1+ their Personality bonus.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="saving-throws">Saving Throws</h3>
<p><strong>Saves</strong> are the default resolution mechanism in this
game. The default difficulty for saves is 12.</p>
<p><strong>Saves</strong> occur when a PC attempts something where the
outcome is uncertain and failure has consequences. Rolls are risks. Good
plans mean less risk and fewer rolls. Poor planning can mean lots of
risky rolls.</p>
<p>The Referee may say “<strong>Save vs Personality</strong>” or ask for
a “<strong>DEX Save</strong>”.</p>
<p>To make a <strong>save</strong> roll 1d20 and add the applicable
<strong>Ability Bonus</strong>. A result of <strong>12+</strong> is a
success.</p>
<p><strong>Saves</strong> are not necessarily a binary pass/fail
resolution mechanism.</p>
<p>Consider if a failed <strong>save</strong> will stall the game. If
not, let the PC fail and suffer the consequences. If a failed
<strong>save</strong> would negatively impact the flow of the game, try
introducing a complication instead. Think of it as success at a
cost.</p>
<p>A failed <strong>save</strong> might mean that the Thief picked the
lock, but their tools break. The Fighter misremembers a bit of gossip
and tips off the guards to their deception. The Wizard scours the
archives for a critical bit of lore, but alerts their enemy’s agents. If
a PC makes a save by a margin of +5 or greater, consider granting them a
small boon: a free action, a bonus to their next roll, etc.</p>
<h3 id="critical-success-and-failure">Critical Success and Failure</h3>
<p>Rolling a natural 20 on a <strong>save</strong> is a critical
success. The PC may receive a boon, such as advantage on a future
related roll.</p>
<p>Rolling a natural 1 is a critical failure. Expect a complication
relevant to the situation at hand.</p>
<h3 id="advantage-disadvantage">Advantage &amp; Disadvantage</h3>
<p>Not all <strong>saves</strong> are equally difficult.</p>
<p>An old castle wall may offer easy hand- and footholds to a climber. A
glass tower could be nearly frictionless. Having proper tools or
foreknowledge of a situation can increase the odds of success.</p>
<p>Likewise, trying to sneak past alert guards in broad daylight will be
significantly more difficult that sneaking past drowsy guards on a
moonless night.</p>
<p>When making a <strong>save</strong> with <strong>advantage</strong>,
roll <strong>2D20</strong> and use the higher result. Use the low result
if making a <strong>save</strong> with
<strong>disadvantage</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="adjusting-dcs">Adjusting DCs</h3>
<p>The standard DC should be adjusted when facing an especially
difficult/easy tasks.</p>
<p>One useful rule-of-thumb relies on level and HD differences. To
calculate the adjustment, compare the difference between the PC’s level
and the task’s or opponent’s level/HD (representing an average
difficulty for a PC of that level). If the difference is larger than 1,
adjust the DC by the difference. E.g., a 1 HD creature saving against a
magical spell by a 2nd-level PC, faces a standard DC of 12. The same 1
HD creature facing a 3rd-level character, now, has to roll 13 or higher
to pass. Conversely, a 4th-level PC trying to open a lock of level 9
with a <strong>DEX save</strong> would face a hefty +5 increase of the
standard DC to 17.</p>
<p>This rule of thumb is particularly useful for Saves involving spells
or combat maneuvers.</p>
<p><strong>OPPOSED SAVES</strong> When 2 or more characters have
mutually exclusive goals, but aren’t in combat.</p>
<p>PCs describe their actions and must save vs the appropriate ability.
The referee decides the number of necessary success to win the context
(typically 1–3 should be enough). Adjust the standard DC12 by the
level/HD difference between the contestants using the <strong>Adjusting
DCs</strong> guidelines.</p>
<p>If the contest requires 2+ successes to be won, count Critical
successes as two successful saves and critical failures as two
failures.</p>
<p><strong>IMPROVING THE ODDS</strong> A PC can improve their odds of
success in a number of ways, the most obvious being by deploying items
from their inventory.</p>
<p>Breaking down the door before the gelatinous cube reaches the party
is a lot easier with a crowbar or sledgehammer. Finding a tomb in a
burning library is easier if a PC knows what it looks like.</p>
<p>In these cases, Referees can award <strong>Advantage</strong> to a
save. It does not have to be the first roll, but the PC must declare
they are using the bonus before they attempt a save.</p>
<p>Using gear to improve the odds leads to wear and tear. On a
successful save using gear, roll a 1d6. A result of 1-2 causes the gear
to loose a <strong>Usage Dot</strong>. On a failed save using gear, the
gear automatically loses one <strong>Usage Dot</strong>. Most gear has
three <strong>Usage Dots</strong> before it is considered
<strong>broken</strong> and must be repaired.</p>
<p><strong>AID</strong> How many PCs can aid another is situational and
up to the Referee.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine how anyone could help a thief pick a lock, but
they might help disable a trap. How many PCs can kick down a door? Can
the illiterate Barbarian help the wizard conduct research?</p>
<p>Receiving <strong>aid</strong>. Give the main PC involved in the
<strong>save</strong> or <strong>opposed save</strong>
<strong>Advantage</strong>. NPCs cannot provide aid.</p>
<p>In matters arcane (like a wizard battle) the caster may spend magic
dice to re-roll failed <strong>saves</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="dungeon-turns">Dungeon Turns</h2>
<p><strong>Turns</strong> are 10 minutes long or can be abstracted to
represent the time it takes to change the state of the party
in-game.</p>
<p>It takes 1 Turn to search an area for traps and secret doors, move to
a new area of the dungeon, pick a lock, resolve a combat, listen at a
door, etc.</p>
<p>More complicated actions will take longer.</p>

<h3 id="the-encounter-sequence">The Encounter Sequence</h3>
<p>When the party moves into a new area or spends time on an exploration
activity, roll the encounter die and interpret the results.</p>
<p>If the PCs are moving cautiously, or have a Hunter in the party, they
get the omen before the encounter and spot signs of traps. The fun part
isn’t noticing the trap, it’s how the PCs deal with it. Use common sense
and inventory items.</p>
<p>PCs moving quickly or incautiously may get a chance to <strong>Save
vs Wisdom</strong> to notice a trap (Referee’s discretion). Otherwise,
they find traps via HP and hirelings. You can cover twice as much ground
between encounter rolls when moving quickly. It’s a gamble whose risks
must be weighed.</p>

<p><strong>SURPRISE</strong> A check for surprise is made by the side/s
that are not expecting the encounter. A monster waiting quietly in the
dark for an incautious party would not roll for surprise. The PCs would.
Light sources can be seen a mile away.</p>
<p>Make a <strong>WIT save</strong> for each PC to determine surprise.
Any surprised groups cannot act in the first round of the encounter.
However, a group that is not surprised gets one free round of

<p><strong>FATIGUE</strong> Sprinting repeatedly, overland travel
without rest, or excessive activity inflict Fatigue. Each level of
Fatigue takes up 1 Item Slot. Fatigue can easily fill up the available
inventory slots and lead to <strong>Encumbrance</strong>.</p>
<p>Resting during <strong>Lunch</strong> or after a <strong>Good Night’s
Rest</strong> can remove fatigue.</p>
<p>At 5 levels of <strong>Fatigue</strong> a PC collapses. They are
conscious but in a death spiral. If they do not consume a ration or
healing potion within 1 Turn, they die. Rest alone will not save
them.</p>
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p><strong>THE COMBAT ROUND</strong> A Round of combat lasts 6 seconds.
A PC can move and perform a single action during a round. This action
may be casting a spell, making a second move, making an attack,
retrieving an item from inventory, attempting a combat maneuver, or any
other action deemed reasonable by the Referee. Some PCs may have access
to <strong>Reactions</strong>, which can be taken out of initiative
order (and only once per round).</p>
<p><strong>PUSH YOURSELF</strong> Any PC can decide to <strong>push
themselves</strong> in a combat round. This gives the PC an extra
<strong>Action</strong> that can be used for a physical activity, e.g.,
another attack, maneuver, or movement (i.e., no spellcasting) at the
cost of 1 <strong>Fatigue</strong>. This can only be done on your own
turn and once per round.</p>
<p><strong>INITIATIVE</strong> At the start of every round, every PC
<strong>saves vs DEX</strong>. On a success, the PC acts before the
enemies. On a failure, they act after the enemies. The Order of Combat
still applies. Spellcasters casting from a book or scroll have to
declare so before initiative is rolled. They automatically fail their
initiative test.</p>

<p><strong>MOVEMENT &amp; DISTANCE</strong> Outside of combat, movement
is generally abstracted. In combat it is more important to know where
everyone is in relation to one another and how far they can move or
shoot.</p>
<p>A lightly armored creature can move 40ft per combat round. A creature
wearing medium or heavy armor receives additional movement penalties
(see <strong>Armor</strong> table). An encumbered creature moves at half
their normal rate. Each level of fatigue reduces movement speed by
5ft.</p>
<p>Some creatures may move faster or slower as noted by their Character
Class.</p>
<p>*Movement may be split or broken up. A creature may make a partial
move, take an action, and then finish their move. They cannot move more
than their normal movement rate.</p>
<p><strong>ATTACKING</strong> Attacks and damage are handled in a single
roll:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Melee Attacks</strong>: Roll weapon damage
+<strong>STR</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ranged Attacks</strong>: Roll weapon
damage+<strong>DEX</strong>. Cannot be used if Close to the target.
Shooting into a melee incurs <strong>Disadvantage</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Two Weapons</strong>: Roll Damage for both weapons and
keep the highest single die.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multiple Attackers</strong>: If more than one character
is attacking the same target, attackers must all roll their Damage
together and keep only the highest single die.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advantage</strong>: Roll your damage roll twice and use
the better result.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Disadvantage</strong>: Attacks that are at Disadvantage,
such as firing through cover, or fighting unarmed, roll their attack
twice and take the worse result.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If your character has the <strong>Extra Attack</strong> feature, you
can attack a second time on your turn (or attempt a combat maneuver). If
this ability is gained from multiple templates, it does not give you any
additional attacks.</p>
<p><strong>DAMAGE</strong> Incoming damage is reduced by the target’s AV
unless otherwise noted (some magical damage might bypass armor). When an
individual takes damage, they lose that much HP. If they take more
damage than their remaining HP, they have to <strong>Save vs
STR</strong>, modified by the excess damage. On a success, they stay
conscious but take a <strong>Wound</strong>. A <strong>Wound</strong>
takes up an inventory slot and incurs a penalty on all saves of -1. On a
failure, the PC goes unconscious and rolls on the <strong>Scars</strong>
table when waking up. A character that incurs <strong>Wounds equal to
their </strong>STR** bonus+1 dies.</p>
<p><strong>HELD ACTIONS</strong> A creature may hold their action until
a specified circumstance triggers it. Held actions not resolved during
the round they are declared are lost.</p>
<p><strong>FIGHTING WITHDRAWAL</strong> The creature moves backwards at
up to half their movement rate. They may attack or fight defensively
(see <strong>Combat Maneuvers</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>RETREAT</strong> The creature turns and flees from melee,
moving up to their full movement rate. This round: the creature may not
attack; their opponent’s attacks have <strong>Advantage</strong> and
ignore any AV bonus due to shields.</p>
<p><strong>CRITICAL SUCCESS</strong> When you roll the maximum on your
weapon damage die, you land a critical hit. This may trigger a special
effect, based on your weapon type.</p>
<p><strong>COMBAT MANEUVERS</strong></p>
<p>Based on their equipment, PCs have access to special tricks during
combat, called <strong>maneuvers</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>MOUNTED COMBAT</strong></p>
<p>Being on a mount in combat lets you exchange your characters movement
for the mounts. A horse and warhorse both have a 60ft movement.</p>
<p>If you take critical damage while mounted, you must succeed a
<strong>DEX save</strong> to not fall prone on the ground. If your mount
is a warhorse, you gain +2 to this roll.</p>
<p>Mounted PCs have access to the <strong>Charge</strong> maneuver.</p>
<p><strong>MORALE</strong></p>
<p>Monsters and NPCs all have a morale rating, usually between 5 and 9.
When they face more danger than they were expecting, the Referee will
make a <strong>morale roll</strong> by rolling 2d6 and comparing the
result to the NPC’s morale rating. If the roll is higher than the
rating, the NPC will attempt to flee, retreat, or parley. Two successes:
If a monster or NPC makes two successful morale checks in an encounter,
it will fight until killed, with no further checks necessary.</p>
<p>Morale rolls can be triggered by drawing first blood, defeating half
of an enemy group, defeating a group’s leader, or reducing a solo enemy
to half HP. Other effects may trigger a morale roll at the Referee’s
discretion.</p>
<p>Retainers also make morale rolls when they aren’t paid, their
employer dies, or they face extraordinary danger. Morale may be improved
by paying retainers more and treating them well.</p>
<p><strong>HEALING</strong></p>
<p>Assuming that you have not died…</p>
<p><strong>1. Lunch</strong>. Heals a character for 25% of their max HP
(round up). Lunch takes 1 hour, requires a safe place, and consumes 1
ration. <strong>Save vs STR</strong> to remove 1
<strong>Fatigue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. A Good Night’s Rest</strong>. Restores all HP, removes 1
<strong>Wound</strong>, and 2 <strong>Fatigue</strong>. Requires 8 hours
of rest, a safe place, a fire or heat source, and consumes 1 ration. For
PCs with <strong>MD</strong>, all of your MD return if you get a
<strong>Good Night’s Rest</strong>. If you didn’t sleep well, your rest
was disrupted by a hazard, or combat, you do not automatically remove
<strong>Fatigue</strong> or recover <strong>MD</strong>. Make two
<strong>STR saves</strong> to remove up to two instances of
<strong>Fatigue</strong> despite a poor rest. Make a <strong>PER
save</strong> for each MD to have them return to your pool anyway. Test
for Random Encounters twice.</p>
<p><strong>3. Magical Healing</strong>. Usually in the form of potions
or spells, heals a character for 50-75% of their max HP (round up).
Ruinously expensive; 10gp per 10% of HP restored. Otherwise works as
Lunch and requires 1 hour to take effect.</p>
<p>Unless found in a dungeon (scrolls/potions) magical healing can be
obtained from a temple or large shrine. Useful for curses, plague,
amputated limbs, death, etc. Large donations to the temple are required
in exchange.</p>

<h2 id="exploration-and-travel">Exploration and Travel</h2>
<p><strong>Hex Crawling</strong></p>
<p>A typical hex represents 6 miles. An adventuring day is divided into
6 <strong>Watches</strong> of approximately 4 hours each. Two of these
phases, approximately 8 hours, must be spent camping in order to avoid
becoming <strong>fatigued</strong>. In each turn, the following
procedure is followed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Action: The party decides on one exploration action for that
turn.</p></li>
<li><p>Event Roll: The GM rolls on the event die for encounters and
other random events if required by the Action.</p></li>
<li><p>Resolution: The action and event rolls are resolved.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exploration Actions</strong></p>
<p>The party may choose one of the following standard actions each
4-hour wilderness turn.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Travel</strong>: passing through a hex and into an
adjacent one. On roads marked on the map, the party travels through two
hexes (three if mounted). Offroad, one hex is traversed. There is also a
2-in-6 chance, when traveling off-road, of getting lost. This is
increased to 3-in-6 in hexes classified as difficult terrain. An
experienced woodsman decreases the chance of getting lost by 1-in-6. If
players get lost, they will need to spend the next turn using the
“search” action to reorient themselves. The effects of getting lost are
rolling a 6d, assigning a number to each side of the hex, and moving the
players one hex off course in that direction. Once the PCs enter a new
Hex, obvious features are revealed. Major features of neighboring
features can be determined from a suitable vantage point. After
resolving the action, roll on the <strong>Event Table</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Explore</strong>: Looking for interesting features within
a hex. There is a 4-in-6 chance of discovering a hidden location in the
hex description. Difficult terrain reduces this to 3-in-6. An
experienced woodsman increases the chance by 1-in-6. Roll on the
<strong>Event Table</strong> with a +2 bonus</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interact</strong>: Staying in the current location
(e.g. exploring a dungeon, town, etc).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Camp</strong>: Resting and/or sleeping. PCs should
determine watches and need the right supplies for a <strong>Good Night’s
Rest</strong>. Roll on the <strong>Event Table</strong> with a -2
penalty.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hunt &amp; Forage</strong>: The party collectively
replenish their supplies from the wilderness. 1d4 rations are gained per
character (apply negative modifier for harsh environments).
<strong>Barbarians, Hunters, Vagabonds &amp; Chefs</strong> or PCs with
a applicable professional background <strong>save vs WIS</strong> to
roll an additional 1d4 for the party. After resolving the action, roll
on the <strong>Event Table</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FATIGUE</strong>: PCs gain 1 level of Fatigue each night they
skip Camp.</p>

<h2 id="adventuring-odds-and-ends">Adventuring Odds and Ends</h2>
<h3 id="rumors">Rumors</h3>
<p>An excellent source of adventure hooks, and potential income/XP, are
rumors. PCs may attempt to learn rumors from NPCs that they meet in a
steading or on the road (or anywhere else for that matter). To discover
a rumor make a <strong>PER Save</strong>.</p>
<p>Good role-playing, plying the NPC with food and drink, flattery, etc.
may allow them to roll with a bonus or advantage.</p>
<h3 id="upkeep">Upkeep</h3>
<p>Adventuring can be profitable sometimes, but it is always
expensive.</p>
<p>The ongoing costs of maintaining gear and armor, municipal fees and
taxes, burning candles to study magic tomes in dark cells, local nobles
taking huge cuts from the treasure you “recovered” on their land, and
the vast quantities of alcohol and psychotropic substances needed to
cope with the things one sees down in those dungeons really add up.</p>
<p>This can be abstracted as <em>Level x10 gp per week</em>.</p>
<p>As PCs gain levels and their powers grow, so too do their appetites.
Any time the party returns to town from adventuring roll 1d6 to
determine how many <em>weeks</em> pass before their next adventure. If
it is winter, roll 1d4 to determine how many <em>months</em> since the
party last ventured out of town.</p>
<p>If the party can’t pay their bills then they are in debt. Some
debt-holders will accept repayment in coin (with interest) but most will
want repayment in the form of a task to be performed. The table opposite
is intended to inspire your own ideas.</p>
<p><em>Upkeep</em> is an abstraction. As PCs gain levels and acquire
treasure their ability to exert influence on the game world increases.
They may wish to open a tavern, build a keep (usually requires a grant
of land) or a wizard’s tower. They may be granted a fief by a local
noble.</p>
<p>These things all have associated costs and responsibilities that can
replace <em>Upkeep</em> at the Referee’s discretion.</p>
<p>Specific rules for these things are beyond the scope of this zine,
but the Internet doth provide. One good source of guidance in this is
Skerples’ blog post, <em>Death, Taxes, &amp; Death Taxes</em> at
coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com</p>
<h3 id="monster-menu">Monster Menu</h3>
<p><em>Simple rules for harvesting monsters and magical creatures for
consumption and profit.</em></p>
<p>Untrained PCs have a 1-in-6 chance of successfully finding and
preparing food scavenged in a dungeon or wilderness. A failed roll means
they ruin all ingredients being used.</p>
<p>It will take 1d4+1 hours to prepare such a meal.</p>
<p>The following add +1 to their chance of success up to a maximum of
4-in-6 chance of success.</p>

<p>Character Classes that make specific mention of prepping meals
(Beastmaster, Chefs, Hunters) are considered trained and competent in
this area and need not make a roll to succeed. Additionally these
classes only require 1 hour to prep and cook a meal/prepare rations.</p>
<p><strong>MAKING RATIONS</strong></p>
<p>Any flora or fauna gathered in the wild or deep within a dungeon will
yield a number of rations equal to twice their hit-dice (HD) and remain
edible for 2 days.</p>
<p>Characters must consume 2 rations a day or they begin to accumulate
levels of <strong>fatigue</strong> – one level for each missed meal.</p>
<p><strong>MAGICAL MONSTERS</strong> Magical creatures count as exotic
ingredients and eating them is not without risk. But the rewards often
make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>Consult the <strong>Monster Menu All</strong> PDF available free at
coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com for specific details on many monster
types.</p>
<p><strong>HARVESTING MONSTERS</strong> Many creatures have valuable
parts such as poison glands, spore sacks, venom projectors, etc.</p>
<p>PCs can attempt a <strong>DEX Save</strong> with a
<strong>-2</strong> modifier to attempt to harvest these organs.
Amazons, Dungeon Gourmands, and Hunters may attempt the save without any
penalty. Dungeon Gourmands of Level 3 or above automatically
succeed.</p>

<h1 id="magic-and-spells"><strong>MAGIC AND SPELLS</strong></h1>
<p>Magic is a powerful and mysterious force in the world. Harnessing
eldritch powers is a dangerous undertaking. Across cultures, many
traditions and approaches exist to bend magic for practical purposes. In
game terms, a <strong>Magic User</strong> (or M-U) is a PC that has
gained at least 1 <strong>Magic Die</strong> or <strong>MD</strong>
through a class template and gained some understanding of magic–ranging
from the intuitive, religious to the analytical. Think of
<strong>MD</strong> as magical fuel.</p>
<p>Having access to <strong>MD</strong> alone though is not enough to
generate any practical effects. A PC needs to have a way of translating
<strong>MD</strong> into effects. This comes in the form of class
abilities (e.g., <strong>Fey Walker</strong> ability to infuse arrows
with magical effects), access to a magical item that already contains a
spell, or the <strong>Spellcasting</strong> ability granted by some
class templates.</p>
<h2 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h2>
<p>If a PC gains the <strong>Spellcasting</strong> feature through a
class template, they gain the ability to translate <strong>MD</strong>
into real world effects in the form of spells. Spells can be cast from
memory (<strong>Signature Spells</strong>), directly from a spellbook or
scroll, or from magic items containing spells. The
<strong>Spellcasting</strong> feature also grants the ability to
<strong>Identify Magic</strong> (see below).</p>
<p>A PC can only ever gain the <strong>Spellcasting</strong> ability
from a single class. That means a PC cannot multi-class into several
classes that grant <strong>Spellcasting</strong> (but they can
multiclass into classes that grant MD and other magical powers).</p>
<p>To cast a spell, select the number of <strong>Magic Dice</strong>
(<strong>MD</strong>) you wish to invest, roll them, and add the numbers
together. <strong>MD</strong> are d6s. As a Magic User, you get 1
<strong>MD</strong> per Magic User template. Most spells depend on the
number of [dice] invested and the [sum] they show. If you roll doubles
you suffer a <strong>Mishap</strong>. If you roll triples you suffer a
<strong>Doom</strong>.</p>
<p>Dice that roll 1-3 return to your casting pool and can be used again
that day. Dice that roll 4-6 are removed from your casting pool for the
day.</p>
<p>Your <strong>MD</strong> return if you get a <strong>Good Night’s
Sleep</strong>. If you didn’t sleep well, you can <strong>Save vs
PER</strong> for each <strong>MD</strong> to have them return to your
pool anyway.</p>
<p>Wearing armor can impinge on the flow of magic energies and hinders
the arm movements necessary to cast spells. Spellcasters can wear Light
armor without any impediment (but that means they don’t get the benefit
of robes). Wearing Medium armor reduces their available Magic Dice by 2.
Wearing Heavy Armor reduces available Magic Dice by 4.</p>
<h3 id="signature-spells">Signature Spells</h3>
<p>A spellcaster can dedicate a substantial amount of practice and study
to commit a spell to memory. Such spells are the spellcaster’s
<strong>Signature Spells</strong>.</p>
<p>The total number of <strong>Signature Spells</strong> is determined
by their <strong>WIT mod</strong>. Each key attribute bonus point
equates to one <strong>Signature Spell</strong>. Spellcasters gain
additional <strong>Signature Spells</strong> through spellcasting class
templates. The number of <strong>Signature Spells</strong> gained
through class templates is equal to 1 per Template <strong>A–C</strong>.
The <strong>Master of Magic</strong> ability grants 5 <strong>Signature
Spells</strong>.</p>
<p>If the spellcaster gains the ability to assign a <strong>Signature
Spell</strong>, either through an ability bonus increase or an
additional class template, they can wait to do so until they find a
suitable spell while adventuring.</p>
<p>To make a spell a <strong>Signature Spell</strong>, the spellcaster
needs either the instruction of a teacher, access to a spellbook
describing the spell, a scroll, or a wand/stave containing the spell. It
takes one week of study to make a spell a <strong>Signature
Spell</strong> and a <strong>save vs WIT</strong>.</p>
<p>Once a spell has become a <strong>Signature Spell</strong>, it cannot
be easily unlearned. The M-U has to dedicate one month of research and
study to replace an existing <strong>Signature Spell</strong> with
another, in addition to the basic requirements for learning a new
spell.</p>
<p>Casting a <strong>Signature Spell</strong> requires <strong>no
save</strong> and the M-U simply has to assign the desired MD to
determine its effect.</p>
<p>A spellcaster can also cast non-<strong>Signature spells</strong>
from spellbooks, scrolls, wands, and staves but this is inherently more
difficult and risky.</p>
<h3 id="spellbooks">Spellbooks</h3>
<p>A spellbook, or grimoire, contains information on up to 10 spells and
occupies 1 Item Slot.</p>
<p>In order to use a spellbook, the PC needs to have gained the
<strong>Spellcasting</strong> ability through a class template (or a
special ability granting their use).</p>
<p>A solid volume, with thick vellum pages and a sturdy cover. Each page
is littered with runes, arcane symbols, diagrams, calculations, and
hand-written notes in the margins, describing the theory and practice of
casting a particular spell. Spellbooks start in a waterproof, acid- and
fire-resistant bag. Outside the bag, they are not waterproof. They are
flammable. And they are also valuable–even an empty book is worth 1000
gp, +500-1,000 gp per spell it may contain.</p>
<p>A spellcaster can try to make a spell in a spellbook one of their
<strong>Signature Spells</strong>, if they have not yet exhausted their
maximum number of signature spells and they pass a <strong>Save vs
WIT</strong>. Attempting to commit a spell to memory takes one week of
study.</p>
<p>Upon gaining the <strong>Book Casting</strong> feature, a spellcaster
can try to cast a spell directly from the spellbook. This is slow and
dangerous because the caster has not yet mastered the spell. The
spellcaster has to declare the intent to cast a spell from their
spellbook <strong>before initiative is rolled for the round</strong>.
They automatically lose initiative and go after the enemies in a fight.
The spellcaster has to decide how many <strong>MD</strong> to invest,
hold the spellbook in their hand, and they cannot move during their
turn. If they take any damage during the round <strong>Save vs
Constitution</strong>. If they fail the save, they fumble the spell and
there is no effect, but the spellcaster still rolls the
<strong>MD</strong> for the purposes of determining
<strong>Mishaps</strong> or <strong>Doom</strong> and the loss of
<strong>MD</strong>.</p>
<p>Some rare spellbooks may also have additional <strong>MD</strong>
stored inside of them.</p>
<h3 id="scrolls">Scrolls</h3>
<p>A scroll is effectively a page from a spellbook with some extra magic
built in. It contains the description of a single spell and the power to
cast it once. Three scrolls fit in one Item Slot.</p>
<p>In order to use a scroll, the PC needs to have the
<strong>Spellcasting</strong> ability, gained through a class template
(or a special ability granting their use).</p>
<p>A spellcaster can try to make a spell on a scroll one of their
<strong>Signature Spells</strong>, if they have not yet exhausted their
number of <strong>Signature Spells</strong> and they pass a <strong>Save
vs WIT</strong>. Attempting to commit a spell to memory requires one
week of study.</p>
<p>A spellcaster can try to cast a spell from the scroll. This is slow
and dangerous because the caster has not yet mastered the spell. The
spellcaster has to declare the intent to cast a spell from as scroll
<strong>before initiative is rolled for the round</strong>. They
automatically lose initiative and go after the enemies in a fight. The
spellcaster has to decide how many <strong>MD</strong> to invest, hold
the scroll in their hand, and they cannot move during their turn. If
they take any damage during the round <strong>Save vs STR</strong>. If
they fail the save, they fumble the spell and there is no effect, but
the spellcaster still rolls the <strong>MD</strong> for the purposes of
determining <strong>Mishaps</strong> or <strong>Doom</strong> and the
loss of <strong>MD</strong>. If they succeed, roll <strong>MD</strong>
as normal to determine the spell’s effect. Doing so unleashes the stored
magic of the scroll. The scroll burns and you add <strong>+1 MD</strong>
to your roll for the purposes of determining the effect. Roll different
colored dice to keep them sorted. This <strong>MD</strong> is
automatically consumed and does not return to your pool.</p>
<p>The <strong>Flame Proof</strong> class ability allows the Wizard to
cast a spell from a scroll without burning it (retaining the +1 MD). A
wizard can invoke this ability once per day.</p>
<h3 id="wands-staves">Wands &amp; Staves</h3>
<p>In order to use a Wand or Stave, the PC needs to have at least one
<strong>M-U</strong> class template (or a special ability granting their
use).</p>
<p>Wands and Staves contain extra <strong>MD</strong> that are tied to
specific spells. Wands provide the ability to cast a single, specific
spell (e.g., a Wand of Magic Missile) and can store up to <strong>4
MD</strong>. Casting a spell from a wand requires <strong>no
save</strong>. The PC has to use at least <strong>1 MD</strong> from the
wand itself, but can add additional <strong>MD</strong> from their own
pool. Roll different colored dice to keep them sorted. Be wary of
rolling too many <strong>MD</strong> at once! Quadruples, quintuples,
sextuples, etc. count as stacking Mishaps in addition to any Doom a PC
might roll.</p>
<p><strong>MD</strong> from the wand are automatically lost, regardless
of what you roll.</p>
<p>You may also invest <strong>1 MD</strong> into the wand per day, and
you take 1d6 damage from the strain. The <strong>MD</strong> invested in
the wand is held there until it is used. Each day, you can add
<strong>+1 MD</strong> to the wand, as above. <strong>MD</strong> moved
to a wand reduces your total for the day, but you regain your full
number of <strong>MD</strong> with a <strong>Good Night’s
Sleep</strong>.</p>
<p>Big wands (staves) can hold up to <strong>6 MD</strong> and cast up
to <strong>3 spells</strong>. The art of making wands died with the
Ancients and they are essentially priceless. Expect to be ambushed by
collectors, thieves, and other wizards if you are unsubtle about
possessing one of these artifacts.</p>
<h3 id="magic-robes">Magic Robes</h3>
<p>The Big Hats and fancy robes are not just fashion statements. Magic
Robes provide <strong>+1 MD</strong> to a spellcaster’s casting pool.
Some ancient robes may even offer more power! Once used, the
<strong>MD</strong> returns to the robes the next day at sunrise.</p>
<p>Anyone with at least one <strong>M-U</strong> class template (or a
special ability granting their use) can wear magic robes in lieu of
armor. That means magic robes can be used to fuel spells but also other
magical abilities.</p>
<p>Obtaining the materials necessary for creating magic garments almost
always involves a quest to a mist shrouded forest or a dismal swamp
where you will undoubtedly do battle with a giant sentient spider or
make promises you cannot keep to an ancient hag.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-magic">Identifying Magic</h3>
<p>Spellcasters can sense magic in the air. By tasting, smelling,
rubbing, or closely inspecting an item, you can tell if it is magical.
You may need to test the item in game to determine what type of magic it
holds. A <strong>WIT save</strong> may reveal additional information
after such.</p>
<h2 id="mishaps">Mishaps</h2>
<p>If you roll doubles while casting a spell, roll on the Mishap table
for your M-U class. Unless otherwise specified, the spell still works.
Magic is dangerous; this was just a hiccup or misfire.</p>
<h2 id="dooms">Dooms</h2>
<p>If you roll triples while casting a spell, one of your wizard Dooms
takes effect. Each class has 3 dooms. The third doom is invariably fatal
or worse. All wizards walk a dangerous path. They burn their souls like
candles, and in doing so, court damnation.</p>
<p>It is possible to seek solutions to a wizard’s doom. These are always
unique quests.</p>
<p><strong>MODIFYING MAGICAL SAVES</strong></p>
<p>Any <strong>Save</strong> for resisting a spell’s effect is modified
by the Level-HD difference between the caster and the target if this
difference is larger than 1. E.g., a Level-5 Wizard casts a spell on a
1-HD goblin. The goblin’s <strong>save</strong> receives an additional
penalty of -4. The the wizard had cast the spell on the 4-HD goblin
captain, no additional penalty is incurred.</p>
<h1 id="equipment"><strong>EQUIPMENT</strong></h1>
<p><strong>ITEM SLOTS</strong></p>
<p>PCs have a number of item slots equal to 10+ their STR bonus. The
number of slots that an item requires is noted in the equipment section.
The first 100 Coins are not counted against item slots, 200 Coins take
up 1 item slot. Bulky treasure also takes up 1 item slot.</p>
<p>The first 4 slots are quick-draw slots, and can be accessed at any
time. You can put weapons, shields, wands, or other hand-held gear into
your quick-draw slots. Worn armor counts to your non-quick-draw
inventory slots. It takes 1 round to retrieve an item from any other
inventory slot. Digging in your pack during combat will give enemies
<strong>advantage</strong> on their attacks against you.</p>
<p>Inventory management is crucial.</p>
<p>Selecting and tracking problem-solving tools and equipment is a
player skill in adventure role-playing games.</p>
<p><strong>ENCUMBRANCE</strong></p>
<p>Carrying more items than you have slots for means that a PC is
encumbered. When encumbered, all saves, skill checks, and to-hit rolls
have disadvantage. The PC also take a movement penalty of 20 ft. You
cannot carry more than twice your inventory.</p>
<h2 id="arms-armor">ARMS &amp; ARMOR</h2>
<p>Each class template confers <strong>proficiencies</strong> with
certain weapons and armor types. A PC that is using a weapon without
proficiency, has to step down the weapon damage by two die types.
Wearing armor without proficiency incurs a general penalty to saves of
-1 for medium armor and -2 for heavy armor.</p>

<p>AV can never be higher than 5.</p>
<p>Sleeping in medium or heavy armor inflicts 1 level of
<strong>Fatigue</strong> that cannot be cleared until a PC’s next
<strong>Good Night’s Sleep</strong>. These armors do incorporate a
padded undergarment that can be slept in and counts as light armor
(equivalent to a Gambeson). It takes 5-10 minutes to put on medium or
heavy armor.</p>
<p><strong>Spellcasters</strong> can wear Light armor without any
impediment. Wearing Medium armor reduces their available Magic Dice by
2. Wearing Heavy Armor reduces available Magic Dice by 4.</p>
<h2 id="adventuring-gear">ADVENTURING GEAR</h2>
<p>All prices are given in “value” to encourage barter and trade in
addition to using gold. Payment for things like ships, real estate, and
so on usually takes the form of trade goods, favors, or oaths of fealty
rather than currency. “Value: 1” is equal to 1 gold coin or 10 silver
pieces.</p>
<p>Adventuring gear can be used to provide <strong>Advantage</strong>
for <strong>Saves</strong> when reasonable. E.g., thieves’ tools can
provide advantage for a lock-picking test or a crowbar for a <strong>STR
save</strong> to break open a door. Using gear in this way causes wear
and tear. On a successful use, roll 1D6. On a 1-2 the item mark a
<strong>Usage Dot</strong>. When three <strong>Usage Dots</strong> are
marked, the gear is broken. Repair costs 50% of the original price.</p>

her “boys”, invariably a tough, scarred mouse with good instincts for
when to get the hell out of dodge and an eye for trouble - and loot. The
real benefit to having her on your payroll though is that the mouse
gangs won’t ever harass a party that has one of her boys tagging
along.</td>

<p>Monsters need HD (1d8 default), HP, Attack, AV, Morale, and special
abilities/crit effects.</p>
<p><strong>HD and Abilities</strong> Range from 1/2-10. Each HD is
roughly 5-9 HP.</p>
<p>Monsters have an average <strong>Save</strong> bonus equal to their
HD. Specific bonuses to STR, DEX, WITS, and PERS should be adjusted up
or down as appropriate (e.g., a lumbering rock monster might have weaker
DEX saves than STR), trading point for point. The <strong>Powerful
Opponents</strong> rule also applies, i.e., when a 4HD monster is
resisting an effect by a PC of Level 2, the DC is lowered by 2.</p>
<p><strong>Attack</strong> Pick a base damage die for the attack
(1d4–1d12) and add 1+HD/2. E.g., a 2HD creature might have a claw attack
of 1d6+2. Exceptional monsters can have higher flat bonuses up to +10.
<strong>Each monster attack causes minimum damage of 1, regardless of
AV</strong>.</p>
<p>Dangerous monsters can have multiple attacks or area-of-effect
attacks. Starting with 4HD, monsters should have two attacks more
often.</p>

</table>
<p><strong>1. Bartholomew’s Pit</strong> R: 50’ T: creature D: 0</p>
<p>Target creature has the illusion of falling into bottomless pit
filled with accusatory voices. Save negates. If they fail, the creature
is stricken with a deep depression (if sentient) or lethargy (if
mindless), and takes [sum] Charisma damage. If they are of [dice] HD or
less, the effect lasts [sum] days, and if [sum] is greater than 12, the
effect is permanent. If the target has more than [dice] HD, the effect
lasts [sum] rounds.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Razor Spiral</strong> R: Self T: [dice]x10’ radius D:
concentration</p>
<p>Blades of invisible force fly around the caster. All creatures in
area take 1d4 damage each round the spell is maintained. Roll damage for
each creature individually, starting with those closest to the caster.
The spell ends automatically when [sum]+3 damage has been dealt. The
blades will also cut or damage fragile objects in the area.</p>
<p><strong>3. Oxhold’s Lament</strong> R: 120’ T: creature D: 0</p>
<p>Target creature of [dice] HD or less must Save vs Fear or take a
Morale check, or believe that someone close to them has suddenly and
tragically died. They will not associate the caster with this death, but
intelligent creatures may believe the caster is only informing them to
cause them grief.</p>
<p><strong>4. Negasonic Ray</strong> R: [dice]x20‘ cone T: area D:
concentration</p>
<p>Rippling rings of purple light pour from the caster’s forehead. All
sounds are cancelled within the area of this spell. Creatures are
deafened until the spell ends or they leave the spell’s area.</p>
<p><strong>5. Summon Candles</strong> R: touch T: object D: 5 minutes /
3hrs</p>
<p>[sum] dribbly candles appear on objects you touch. You can walk
around placing candles as required, for up to 5 minutes. The candles are
lit and burn for 3 hours. They can be detached, but will fade from
existence within 5 minutes. If any spells are cast within an area
illuminated by a summoned candle, the candle’s flame will turn blue and
point to the caster.</p>
<p><strong>6. Perilous Bridge</strong> R: [dice]x100’ T: object D:
1hr</p>
<p>A shimmering bridge of force appears from an object the caster
touches, and extends, perfectly level, in a single direction. Both ends
of the bridge must touch solid objects. The bridge is 1’ wide and thin
as a sheet of paper. Slowly walking across it does not require a Save vs
Dexterity, but running or a slight breeze will require one. The bridge
shatters if it is dealt any damage.</p>
<p><strong>7. Wending Bolt</strong> R: 200’ T: creature D: 0 Target
takes [sum] damage. You do not need to see the target, but you do need
to know their approximate location (within 10’), and there must be a
clear path a bolt could trace to reach them. The path can be as
convoluted as required. The bolt can pass through gaps as small as a
fist.</p>
<p><strong>8. Thunderclap</strong> R: 200’ T: creature D: 0</p>
<p>Target takes 1d6 damage. All creatures within [dice]x10’ of the
target are deafened for [sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, the
effect is permanent.</p>
<p><strong>9. Compartmentalize Mixture</strong> R: touch T: object D:
1hr</p>
<p>Command a mixture of items (a soup, a pile of coins) that weigh no
more than [dice]x100lbs to separate into [sum]+1 categories. The
separation is slow, and hindered by even the slightest effort. The
categories must be clearly defined and identifiable by inspection. For
example, you could split a soup into “vegetables” “broth” and “poison”,
or a pile of coins into “minted during the last century” and “older”.
You could not, however, split a pile of coins into “handled by Xerphion
the Tyrant” and “not handled by Xerphion the Tyrant”, as there’s no way
to tell just by inspecting them. You could not separate “a locked chest”
and “its contents”, because the items could not flow freely into
separate piles.</p>
<p><strong>10. Master Ludwig’s Guiding Lights</strong> R: [dice]x1 miles
T: self D: [sum] hours</p>
<p>Small glowing lights flow from your fingertips. They are as bright as
a match, but you can always see them, even in bright sunlight or pitch
darkness, at any distance up to 1 mile. The lights guide the caster to
an object, person, or location that they believe will result in the
emotional state named when the spell is cast. If the caster names
“love”, they will lead to the nearest sexually compatible person of
similar age. If the caster names “joy” they might lead to a well of
nitrous oxide, or to a pile of treasure, or to a crude goblin joke
scrawled on a wall. The lights are not malicious, but they are not very
clever.</p>
<p><strong>11. Roaring Flames</strong> R: 30’ cone T: area D: 0</p>
<p>A wide cone of crackling fire races across the ground. Creatures in
the area take [sum] damage, Save vs Dex for half. The flames are
particularly damaging to inanimate objects, which take [sum]x2 damage.
Creatures and objects are not set on fire by this spell.</p>
<p><strong>12. The Astrologer’s Helper</strong> R: 10’ T: self D: [sum]
minutes</p>
<p>Outlines of the planets, major stars, sun, and moon appear around
you. You can use them to determine the time of day, true north, and your
approximate position on the globe. You can also spend 5 minutes to read
the horoscope of [dice] sentient creatures per casting. Roll 1d10. 1-8.
No effect aside from the usual platitudes. 9. Doom. Creature must reroll
their next Save and take the worse result. 10. Triumph. Creature
automatically passes their next Save.</p>
<p><strong>13. Heroic Leap</strong> R: touch T: creature D: [dice]
minutes</p>
<p>Target can leap up to [sum]x5’ high and/or [sum]x5’ forward in a
straight line. They take no damage on landing, provided they land on or
above the level they started from. For example, you could leap from the
ground to top of a steeple, or you could leap over the steeple to land
on the ground, but you couldn’t leap from the top of a steeple to the
ground. On landing, the target may Save vs Dex with a +[dice] bonus to
change direction and repeat the leap. You cannot cast spells or attack
while leaping.</p>
<p><strong>14. The Magnificent Sponge</strong> R: touch T: point D:
[dice] hours</p>
<p>You summon a yellow sponge the size of your head. The sponge can
instantly absorb up to [sum]x100L of liquid without growing heavier. You
can squeeze the liquid free, but only at the rate of a normal sponge
(10L/minute). The sponge can be reused if it is wrung out completely. If
you cast this spell with 4 [dice], the sponge lasts for a year and a
day, but the spell does not return to your spellbook until the sponge
duration expires or the sponge is dispelled. The sponge is impervious to
harm caused by the liquids it absorbs.</p>
<p><strong>15. Ice-Bridge Step</strong> R: touch T: [dice] creatures D:
[sum] minutes</p>
<p>You can run over water as if it were land. Ice forms beneath your
feet with each step. If you slow down, you’ll sink. Very wavy seas may
require you to Save vs Dex.</p>
<p><strong>16. Embroider Deed</strong> R. Touch T: object (cloth) D:
permanent</p>
<p>By dictating descriptions of your heroic deeds, you can cause a
tapestry to sew itself into cloth you provide. The cloth can be as small
as a handkerchief or as large as a house’s wall. The deeds must focus on
you and your actions, but other characters can be added in, as required
by the story. The tapestry is worth [sum]x10gp. It takes [dice] hours of
work to dictate the tale, and if you are interrupted, you must Save or
the spell fails.</p>
<p><strong>17. Multielemental Spray</strong> R. 15’ cone T: area D:
varies</p>
<p>If [sum] is equal to or greater a creature in the area’s HD, they
take 1d4 fire damage. If [sum] is twice the creature’s HD or more, they
also take 1d4 cold damage. If [sum] is three times the creature’s HD or
more, they take 1d4 lightning damage. If [sum] is four times the
creature’s HD or more, they also take 1d4 acid damage and are knocked
prone.</p>
<p><strong>18. Miniature Sandstorm</strong> R: 30’ radius T: self D:
[dice] hours</p>
<p>You cough up a swirling spiral of sand. Everything up to 30’ away
from you is obscured. The sand deals no damage, but creatures move at
half speed within the sandstorm’s effect.</p>
<p><strong>19. Embed Memory</strong> R. touch T: creature D: varies</p>
<p>You pull a single memory out of your head and transfer it to another
creature. Unwilling creatures may Save to negate. The memory must be
short, and it must be distinct. The memory is perfectly vivid for [sum]
days but begins to fade after that. If [sum] is greater than 12, the
memory will never fade, even if the target loses all other memories.</p>
<p><strong>20. Moon Lust</strong> R: 50’ T: creature D: varies</p>
<p>Target creature loves the moon. They want to stare at it, jump up and
hold it, or write poems about it. If [sum] is equal to or greater than
the target’s HD, they are stunned for 1d6 rounds. If [sum] is greater
than 12, the target is stunned for 2d6 rounds and becomes permanently
obsessed with the moon.</p>
<p><strong>21. Orbiting Spikes</strong> R: 30’ T: self D: [sum]
rounds</p>
<p>You summon [dice] daggers of force that orbit your head like a very
angry halo. With a thought, even if you are doing something else, you
can throw a spike at a target. Treat this as a thrown dagger, but with a
maximum range of 30’. You can throw one spike per round.</p>
<p><strong>22. Resonating Command</strong> R: 50’ T: creature that can
hear and understand you D: 3 rounds</p>
<p>You shout a single-word command to your target, who must Save or
obey. For two rounds after you cast this spell, it resonates. Targets
who previously passed their Save must Save again at the beginning of the
next 2 rounds, with a +4 bonus the first round and a +8 bonus the
second. The command cannot directly cause the target harm, or force them
to commit a directly harmful action. You could cause them to run into a
trap they didn’t know was there, or into a tactically disadvantageous
position, but not off a cliff. For each [dice] you add past the first,
you can affect 2 additional creatures, or add an additional word to your
command.</p>
<p><strong>23. Flip Person</strong> R: 50’ T: [dice] creatures D: 0</p>
<p>Target creatures with total HD of [sum] or less are flipped
head-over-heels, to land on their feet unharmed and in the same
position. Loose items, coins, etc. may be shaken free. Targets must Save
or be stunned for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>24. Sword of Infamy</strong> R: touch T: sword D: [sum]
rounds</p>
<p>Creatures killed by a sword you target reveal their souls briefly
before death. For most creatures, the soul appears as a small, vaporous
homunculus which vanishes after a few moments. This effect may cause a
Save vs Fear or a Morale check.</p>
<p><strong>25. Hammon’s Arrow-Directing Lens</strong> R: 200’ T:
creature D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>A lens of force appears 5’ over the target. Any arrows that pass
within [dice]x10’ of the lens are directed to the target. Make a new
attack roll if the arrows would have ordinarily missed the target. This
only affects arrows, not stones, spears, or crossbow bolts.</p>
<p><strong>26. Pergaman’s Synesthesia</strong> R: touch T: creature of
[dice]x2 HD or less D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>The target’s senses are confused and mixed. Colours also evoke
sounds. Tastes evoke flashes of light. Different textures cause
different flavours. The target is befuddled for the spell’s duration. If
[sum] is greater than 12 the effect is permanent, but the target will
become used to their new senses and no longer befuddled in 20-Int
days.</p>
<p><strong>27. Lengthen Limbs</strong> R: touch T: willing creature D:
[sum] minutes</p>
<p>Up to [dice]x2 of the target’s limbs double in length. If all a
creature’s walking limbs are affected, the creature’s move speed is also
doubled for the duration of the spell. Weapons wielded in a lengthened
limb can reach farther than normal. This effect does not change the
structure or form of the limbs. It merely affects one of the many
dimensions surrounding them, which also causes the limbs to appear
farther away than usual. If you invest 3 or more [dice] the spell’s
duration becomes [sum] hours.</p>
<p><strong>28. Alter Local Gravity</strong> R: 50’ T: [sum]x5’ squares
D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>You must cast this spell indoors, in an area with a solid roof no
more than 50’ high. An areas that you specify has its gravity altered a)
an angle that you specify (90 degrees left, 180 degrees up), or b) to a
lower strength that you specify (50%, 0%) for the duration of the spell.
The spell’s effect takes place gradually, giving creatures a chance to
Save vs Dex to hang on to something. Creatures take fall damage as
normal. In lower gravity, you can jump proportionately higher and
farther, but virtually any action requires a Save vs Dex. If you invest
3 or more [dice] the spell’s duration becomes a year and a day.</p>
<p><strong>29. Thicken Air</strong> R: 50’ T: [sum]x5’ squares, 50’ high
D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>Air in an area you select becomes as dense as water. You can still
breathe it, but you can also swim in it. Projectiles passing through the
area count as moving twice as far for range penalties. Flying creatures
entering the area must Save or be stunned for one round. If you invest 3
or more [dice] the spell’s duration becomes a year and a day.</p>
<p><strong>30. Scything Disc of Nog</strong> R: 200’ T: creature D:
0</p>
<p>You fire a whirling disc of force and light from your fingertip. The
disc screeches like a sawblade. It deals [sum] damage to its target. If
it deals more than 6 damage, it bounces towards a random creature within
20’, dealing [sum]-2 damage. If it deals more than 6 damage, it bounces
towards another random creature within 20’, dealing [sum]-4 damage. This
continues, losing 2 damage with each bounce, until there are no valid
targets or the spell deals 6 or less damage to a creature.</p>
<p><strong>31. Delayed Noxious Odour Sphere</strong> R: 50’ T: point D:
[sum] rounds/0</p>
<p>A marble-sized bead of grey-green ooze lands at a point you select.
At any time within [sum] rounds, you can cause the sphere to detonate.
Any creatures within a 20’ of the sphere’s detonation must Save vs
Constitution or flee the area, as a failed Morale check, to wash. The
area is filled with a thick green mist that lasts for [dice] hours. The
spell does not affect creatures with no sense of smell, mindless
creatures, or creatures who habitually live in filth (goblins, shambling
mounds, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>32. Scuttle</strong> R: touch T: [dice] creatures D: [sum]
minutes</p>
<p>Your clothes and hair animate to carry you. You can move at full
speed in any orientation, and you can freely rotate as you move. For
instance, you could run while standing on your head, holding a torch,
and turning counterclockwise. You can lie on your side and, while
flipping end over end, move backwards. This effect does not allow you to
climb up walls, but you can climb ladders or rope at twice your usual
speed.</p>
<p><strong>33. Gelatinous Form</strong> R: touch T: self D: [sum]
minutes</p>
<p>Your flesh becomes gelatinous. You can squeeze through gaps as small
as keyhole with a great deal of effort. You take no damage from
bludgeoning weapons for the duration of the spell. Any acid damage you
take heals HP instead. Your clothes and items are not affected by this
spell.</p>
<p><strong>34. Transfer Exhaustion</strong> R: 20’ T: self, creature D:
0</p>
<p>This spell can only be cast if you are exhausted. At a bare minimum,
you need one sleepless or restless night. You bundle your exhaustion
into a ball and toss it at a creature. The creature must Save or be
stunned for [dice] rounds. You immediately heal [dice]x2 HP. The
creature may take on some aspects of your personality. This spell has no
effect if you have less than 0 HP.</p>
<p><strong>35. William’s Fingerbreaker</strong> R: 100’ T: creature of
[dice]x2 HD or less D: 0</p>
<p>The target of this spell must have fingers. You snap your fingers and
your target’s fingers crack, break, and bend. They take [sum] damage and
must immediately Save or drop whatever they are holding. You can choose
to have the target take no damage, but they get +2 to their Save.</p>
<p><strong>36. Geld Animal</strong> R: 20’ T: creature of [dice]x2 HD or
less D: [sum] days The target must Save or take 1 damage, and lose
[dice]+1d4 Strength, to a minimum of 1, for the duration of this spell.
The target is also rendered sterile for the duration. There are no
visible physical effects from this spell. If [sum] is greater than 12,
the target is rendered sterile permanently, but they will recover their
lost Strength after [sum] days. This spell only works on living
creatures capable of reproducing.</p>
<p><strong>37. Draw Heat</strong> R: [dice]x100’ T: 2 objects or
creatures D: concentration</p>
<p>You must have at least two working eyes to cast this spell. You stare
at one target with one eye, and another target with another. You can
transfer heat between them. For example, if you stared at a torch, you
could transfer the fire’s heat (1d6 damage)/round) to a creature. You
can do nothing else while casting this spell. You cannot amplify the
heat, so a candle’s flame cannot melt an iron bar, but you could
transfer the icy cold of a glacier to a campfire and extinguish it.</p>
<p><strong>38. Thurmond’s Prolonged Bombardment</strong> R: 200’ T:
creature or object D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>Each round, a fist-size sphere of force appears and slams into the
target, dealing 1d6+[dice] damage. Save each round to negate. If the
target is human-sized or smaller and takes 7 damage, it is also knocked
prone.</p>
<p><strong>39. Visualize Madness</strong> R: 20’ T: creature D: [sum]
minutes</p>
<p>Target must be insane. The spell create an illusory scene above the
target’s head that conveys their insanity. If a king believes himself to
be an owl, the illusion might show a forest of trees and a grey owl
crowned with gold flitting among them. If the target is paranoid,
shadowy figures with long knives might surround their head, plotting and
muttering. The target cannot see the illusion.</p>
<p><strong>40. Cuspit’s Swarm of Irritating Vermin</strong> R: 50’ T:
[dice] creatures or objects D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>A cloud of tiny magical insects attack your target. They do 1 damage
per round to living creatures and no damage to nonliving creatures or
objects. Each round, a non-mindless creature must Save or take a -2
penalty to their next Attack. If the target is an object, the vermin
will do minor cosmetic damage, such as chewing holes in paper, gnawing
wood, chipping paint, and scratching glass.</p>
<p><strong>41. Cone of Dense Foam</strong> R: [dice]x10’ cone T: area D:
0</p>
<p>A huge cone of white foam sprays from your hand. It’s as dense as
porridge, but tastes like seawater. Creatures inside must Save vs Con or
begin to drown unless they struggle free. Any creatures covered in foam
have -2 to Attack until they can wash.</p>
<p><strong>42. Weighty Sphere</strong> R: touch T: point D: [sum]
hours</p>
<p>You summon a stone sphere with a radius up to [dice]x2’. The sphere
is immensely heavy. 2’ radius: 2.5 tons. 4’ radius: 22.5 tons. 6’
radius: 78 tons. 8’ radius: 182 tons. It is perfectly smooth and very
difficult to lift. You must summon the stone onto a stable surface. For
example, you can’t summon it by touching water or sand, but you could
summon it on top of a flimsy wooden railing. If you invest 3 or more
[dice], you can make the spell’s duration permanent.</p>
<p><strong>43. Duelist’s Wings</strong> R: touch T: [dice] creatures D:
[sum] rounds</p>
<p>Tiny white wings sprout from your ankles and wrists. In combat, you
may make a free Combat Maneuver to reposition yourself each turn. Your
move speed increases by 5’ and you reduce all fall damage by 2.</p>
<p><strong>44. Screaming Teeth</strong> R: 50’ T: creature D: [sum]
varies</p>
<p>Target’s teeth scream whenever the target opens its mouth. The
screaming is very unpleasant, and causes them to lose [dice]+1d4
Charisma, to a minimum of 1, for the duration of the spell. The target
may Save at the end of each duration interval to negate the effects. 1
[dice]: rounds, 2 [dice]: days, 3 [dice]: weeks, 4 [dice] months. The
spell fails if the target has no teeth.</p>
<p><strong>45. Beatific Scrying</strong> R: 1 mile T: creature D: [sum]
rounds</p>
<p>You gain a misty vision of the nearest sentient creature, aside from
creatures you can see, who is performing a genuinely kind or selfless
act. You might see a mother tucking her squabbling children into bed or
a gardener freeing a wounded fox from a trap. If no targets are
available, the spell fails.</p>
<p><strong>46. Glamour of Servitude</strong> R: touch T: sentient
humanoid creature D: [sum] varies, see below</p>
<p>Target’s clothes transform into livery. Other minor cosmetic effects,
such as a change in hair colour, may also occur. The target appears to
be a minor servant or hireling. This effect is so convincing that even
people close to the target will believe the target has been demoted or
promoted, and must Save to believe otherwise. The target may Save at the
end of each duration interval to negate the effects. 1 [dice]: minutes,
2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: months, 4 [dice] years</p>
<p><strong>47. Ulric’s Beam of Blindness</strong> R: 100’ T: creature of
[dice]x2 HD or less D: varies</p>
<p>A brilliant white ray shoots from your forehead. Target must Save or
go blind for: 1 [dice]: minutes, 2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: months, 4
[dice] years. You may chose any number of the target’s eyes to blind.
This spell can be reflected by mirrors</p>
<p><strong>48. Saw and Plane Tree</strong> R: touch T: 1 tree D: 0</p>
<p>A tree no larger than 60’ tall and 25’ in diameter topples over, as
if neatly cut. The result depends on the dice you invest. 1 [dice]: cut
and broadly de-limbed, 2 [dice]: cut, de-limbed, debarked, 3 [dice]:
cut, de-limbed, debarked, cut into planks as per your specifications,
stacked, 4 [dice] cut, planed, de-limbed, debarked, cut into planks,
stacked, sanded, and finished. Small limbs and offcuts will be piled for
kindling. Alternatively, you can reduce the tree to sawdust or wood
chips in 24-[sum] minutes</p>
<p><strong>49. Glorious Starburst</strong> R: 100’ T: area D: [sum]
rounds</p>
<p>You fire a flare 100’ upwards. It hovers there, providing light as
bright as moonlight for 300’ around you, for [sum] rounds. You can
command the starburst to move horizontally, change colour, rise an
additional 100’ per round, or explode into sparkles. If it strikes a
creature or object, it deals 1d6 fire damage and then explodes into
sparkles.</p>
<p><strong>50. Identify Owner</strong> R: touch T: object D: 1
minute</p>
<p>Letters appear over the object you touch, spelling out the name of
the object’s owner or owners. If the object has no owners, the spell
fails. If you invest 2 [dice] the spell will also show if the ownership
is disputed. Dead people cannot dispute ownership. If you invest 3
[dice], arrows will appear pointing in the approximate direction of the
owner (or a skull will appear if they are deceased). The name revealed
will be name the owner used when they purchased or acquired the object.
For example, if Tabitha Winklewort was using her alias “Jane Crow” when
she bought her boots, the name listed would be Jane Crow. If you
targeted a ring she stole and invested 2 [dice] or more, the names
listed would be Jane Crow and Baron Summerland. If you invest 4 [dice],
true names will be listed alongside aliases, provided the owners are
mortal. This spell also works on slaves and domesticated animals.</p>
<p><strong>51. Become Delicious</strong> R: touch T: creature of
[dice]x2 HD or less D: [sum] varies</p>
<p>Target creature smells and tastes delicious for the spell’s duration.
The smell radiates 20’ in calm air, but can spread via wind or leave a
trail. Sentient creatures can usually resist the urge to eat the target
without a Save, but animals and other ravenous creatures must Save or
select the spell’s target as their primary attack target. Insects will
be attracted to the target for the spell’s duration. The target may Save
at the end of each duration interval to negate the effects. 1 [dice]:
minutes, 2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: months, 4 [dice] years. This spell
can also affect dead creatures.</p>
<p><strong>52. Cube of Spell Splitting</strong> R: 50’ T: point D:
[dice]+1 rounds</p>
<p>A 5’ cube of grey light appears in the air at a point you specify. It
can be targeted by non-magical attacks (Defense 10, 5 HP) and disappears
if it takes more than 5 damage. At any point during the spell’s
duration, spells that enter the cube through one of it’s faces will be
split, and identical copies will fire out of the spell’s 5 other faces.
The copies are not specifically targeted, but will hit any valid targets
in their path, and within the original spell’s range. For example, you
could fire a magic missile straight through the cube at a target 30’
away from the cube. Four other magic missiles would fire from the other
four sides of the cube and disappear after 30’ unless they hit a target
or obstacle within 30’. Touch spells and spells with a range of “self”
are not affected. Other spellcasters can use your cube.</p>
<p><strong>53. Entangling Smoke</strong> R: 50’ T: [dice]x2 objects or
creatures D: varies</p>
<p>Target creature or object is grabbed by tendrils of thick black
smoke. Save vs Dex to negate, prone creatures automatically fail. Target
moves at half speed and takes a -2 penalty to Attack until it can win an
opposed Strength test against the smoke to end the effect. The effective
Strength of the smoke depends on the dice invested. 1 [die]: 10, 2
[dice]: 14, 3 [dice]: 18, 4 [dice] 20.</p>
<p><strong>54. Capture Wind</strong> R: touch T: point D:
concentration</p>
<p>A magical circle [dice]x2’ in radius extends from your fingertip. As
long as you maintain concentration, you can absorb any wind passing
through the circle. You can then collapse the spell. At any point, as
long as you devote a spell slot to maintaining the spell, you can
reactivate it with the same radius (no [dice] are needed) to release the
wind you absorbed. The wind flows out at the same rate it entered. If
you activate this spell in a light breeze for 5 minutes, the spell will
release a light breeze over 5 minutes. The wind only flows from the
circle, so anyone standing behind it is not affected (unless you release
hurricane-force winds indoors). You can cancel the release at any time,
which expends the spell as usual. If you die while this spell is
“loaded” and in your brain, it activates facing a random direction.</p>
<p><strong>55. Enfeebling Sigil</strong> R: touch, 50’ T: object D:
[sum] rounds</p>
<p>A writhing arcane symbol appears on an object you touch. Any creature
within 100’ of the sigil who looks at it must Save or be reduced to
Strength 1 for [dice] rounds. Nothing can cause their Strength to drop
lower than 1 while they are under the effects of this spell. The symbol
vanishes after [sum] rounds. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, you can
instead set the duration of this spell to permanent, provided no one
looks at the sigil. Once it is seen, the duration becomes to [sum] round
as usual.</p>
<p><strong>56. Redwyn’s Excellent Clamp</strong> R: 30’ T: object D:
[sum] varies</p>
<p>A clamp of red light appears over one or two objects you designate.
The maximum width of the clamp is [dice]x10’. The clamp will push the
objects together until they are held securely (effective strength of
20), but it will not damage either object or any living creatures. If
you designated an orc’s shirt and the back of a chair as targets, the
clamp would firmly secure the orc to the chair. The clamp must be able
to fit around the objects. You could not secure a chair to the floor or
walls. Creatures can break free with an opposed Strength check, and,
most of the time, can wriggle free in a few hours. The spell lasts for 1
[dice]: minutes, 2 [dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: days, 4 [dice] months, or
permanent.</p>
<p><strong>57. Light’s Own Scourge</strong> R: [dice]x20’ radius T:
light sources in area D: 0</p>
<p>All light sources in the radius of this spell deal damage to the
creature nearest to them. Candles and matches deal no damage. Torches
and lanterns deal 1d6 damage. Bonfires deal 2d6 damage. Magical light
sources with a duration of at least 1 round deal damage equal to the
[dice] invested in their casting +1d6. If a light source deals 4 or more
damage it is also extinguished.</p>
<p><strong>58. Scamper’s Bouncing Sphere of Destruction</strong> R:
touch T: point D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>A small yellow sphere appears on your fingertip and fires off at
enormous speed. Any creatures struck must Save or be stunned for 1
round. If you cast this spell outside, or in a very large room with
multiple exits, you strike 1 target before the spell vanishes into the
distance. If you cast this spell indoors, in a room with a limited
number of exits, the sphere is trapped and begins to bounce around at
high speed. The effects depend on the room size. 400 square feet or less
(20’x20’): all creatures must Save or be stunned each round for the
spell’s duration. All objects that could be shattered or broken have a
20% chance of breaking each round. This includes potions, flimsy
furniture, windows, etc. 1600 square feet or less (40’x40’): creatures
have a 20% chance per round to be hit. Objects have a 10% chance of
breaking each round. Any larger rooms: creatures have a 5% chance per
round to be hit. Objects have a 5% chance of breaking each round. These
chances may be adjusted by the GM depending on the room size and
contents. If you invest 3 [dice] or more in this spell, creatures that
fail their Save also take 1 damage. If you invest 4 [dice] or more,
creatures that fail their Save are also knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong>59. The Creature Comforts of Tuttle Wren</strong> R: 10’ T:
area D: [sum]x2 hours</p>
<p>In an area you designate, no larger than 15’x15’ by 10’x high, a
magical camp appears. The camp includes a bedroll, a sleeping platform,
a small purple and gold tent, a small table and chair, a kettle, a
cookpot, an iron arm to hold the kettle or cookpot over a fire, a book
entitled “The Erotic Poems of Plumtarch” (less erotic than expected),
and a pair of dry wool socks. Any items removed from the area vanish
instantly. In the spell’s area, the temperature is moderated very
slightly, wind and rain are lessened, and vermin cannot enter.</p>
<p><strong>60. Package Neatly</strong> R: 20’ T: objects D:
concentration / permanent</p>
<p>Up to [dice]x500lbs of nonliving objects, as you designate, are
packed neatly. You must name the objects or their general category when
you cast the spell (“those coins”, “the contents of that room”) If no
packing materials are provided, the objects will be stacked into compact
cubes, with the largest and most stable objects at the bottom. If
chests, paper and twine, sacks, carts, etc. are provided, the spell will
use them as you direct. The packages created will take up the minimum
space possible, and will be remarkably sturdy. The spell will continue
to pack objects for as long as you maintain concentration. The objects
must be able to move freely. You could not use this spells to pack
clothes someone was wearing. The objects will not lift more than 10’ off
the ground during the packing process.</p>
<p><strong>61. Flying Syringe</strong> R: 100’ T: object, creature D:
0</p>
<p>You must hold a potion, vial of poison, or other liquid in one hand
while you cast this spell. The spell changes the potion’s container into
a glass dart and fires it at an enemy within range. The enemy must Save
or be struck and immediately take the effects of the potion. If you
invest 2 [dice] or more, you can redirect a missed syringe, once, to a
new target with a successful Save vs Int. If you invest 3 [dice] or
more, you can mix [dice] potions together into the same syringe. If you
invest 4 [dice] or more, the target does not get a Save.</p>
<p><strong>62. Spitting Stone</strong> R: touch T: object D: [sum]
hours</p>
<p>You touch a stone no larger than your head, and it grows a face that
resembled a gargoyle’s. You can designate [dice] conditions under which
the stone face will discharge water. You could say “always”, “whenever
any one but me walks past”, “only when an orc walks past”. The
conditions must be obvious. The stone is not very observant. The water
sprayed by the stone does not deal damage, but it has a 50% chance to
extinguish torches. The water disappears once it passes more than 100’
from the stone. The stone sprays water in a [dice]x5’ cone. If you
invest 4 [dice] or more, creatures passing through the cone must Save vs
Dex or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><strong>63. Shackle to the Earth</strong> R: 100’ T: [dice] creatures
D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>Targets must be touching the ground. For as long as the spell is
active, they must keep at least one limb touching the ground at all
times. They can jump or run if they make an opposed Strength check
against Strength 20. If a target is knocked prone, they must Save vs
Strength to rise from prone. Targets take a -2 penalty to all Saves vs
Dex.</p>
<p><strong>64. Legulian’s Potion Alloy</strong> R: touch T: objects D:
permanent</p>
<p>You combine up to [dice] potions in a flask or [dice] flasks that can
contain them. The mixture is stable. None of the usual rolls for mixing
potions are made. The new potion or potions have all the effects of the
originals.</p>
<p><strong>65. Mind Labyrinth</strong> R: 0 T: self D: [sum] hours</p>
<p>You create a spiraling labyrinth of thought in your mind. Anyone
attempting to read your mind or cast a memory-altering spell must Save
or become trapped in the labyrinth. Once per hour, they can Save vs Int
to escape. Very experienced mind readers may expended a [die] to
automatically escape in 1d10 minutes. While a creature is trapped in
your mind, you can distantly hear it’s thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>66. Roiling Polymorph</strong> R: 10’ T: willing creature, or
unwilling creature of [dice]x2 HD or less D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>For the next [sum] rounds, target creature transforms through a wide
variety of shapes. Save once at the start of the spell to negate. Roll
on the list below at the start of each round: 1-2: no change from
current form, 3: small mammal, 4: small amphibian, 5: small bird, 6:
small crustacean, 7: medium mammal, 8: medium bird, 9: creature of the
same size and species as the target, but of different appearance, 10:
creature of the same size as the target, but different species and
appearance. The creature’s Stats and HP are quartered when transformed
into a small creature and halved when transformed into a medium
creature. When the spell’s effect ends, the creature is stunned for 1d6
rounds.</p>
<p><strong>67. Horsebane</strong> R: 100’ T: area D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>A circle 20’ in radius becomes sticky and soft. Creatures in the area
move at half speed and take 1 damage per round. Any creature that was
running or charging in the round before this spell was cast must Save vs
Dex or take [sum] damage and be immobilized for 1d6 rounds. Creatures
with multiple legs get -4 to their Save.</p>
<p><strong>68. Move Enchantment</strong> R: touch T: objects D:
permanent</p>
<p>You touch an enchanted object with one hand and a ritually prepared
object with your other hand. Save, with a +2 bonus for each [dice]
invested in this spell. If you succeed, the enchantment moves to the new
object. If you fail, the enchantment vanishes forever. You take a -2
penalty to the Save for each [dice] the caster invested in the original
enchantment, and a -2 penalty if the target item and the original item
are significantly different. It’s not easy to move the enchantment for a
sword into a ring, but you could probably move an enchantment from a
ring to a crown without too much trouble.</p>
<p><strong>69. Mangling Blows</strong> R: 100’ T: creature D: 0</p>
<p>Invisible hammers of force strike from every direction. Target
creature takes [sum] bludgeoning damage, Save for half, and is pushed
[dice]x5’ in a random direction.</p>
<p><strong>70. Conflicting Command</strong> R: 50’ T: creature that can
hear and understand you D: 0</p>
<p>You shout a magic phrase to your target. To you, and to anyone else,
it is incomprehensible but your target interprets it as a magical
command that is impossible to fulfill. “Fall down and jump up at the
same time” is a possible translation, but the conflict is more
fundamental. The target takes [sum]+ their Intelligence bonus damage and
is stunned for [dice] rounds. Save negates.</p>
<p><strong>71. Paralyze Bird</strong> R: 200’ T: creature with feathered
wings D: [sum] rounds</p>

They may make a new Save at the start of each round.</p>

[sum] hours</p>
<p>Gold you target becomes liquid and flows like thick soup. It is cold
to the touch. Alloyed metals are also carried with the gold, though they
may appear as streaks or bubbles in the liquid. The gold reforms into
its original shape when the spell ends.</p>
<p><strong>73. Butterfly Hurricane</strong> R: 30’ radius T: self D:
[sum] rounds</p>
<p>You create a whirling, brightly coloured mass of butterflies that
cloaks you completely. Any ranged attacks fired into our out of the
hurricane automatically miss. Attacks that target an area (such as a
dragon’s fire breath or a circle of frost) are not affected. Creatures
other than the caster who end their turn inside the hurricane must Save
or be befuddled for 1 round.</p>
<p><strong>74. Paper Automaton</strong> R: touch T: paper D: [sum]
hours</p>
<p>You enchant a piece of plant-based paper or parchment to obey your
commands. The paper folds into a tiny humanoid shape and follows simple
instructions. It can lift nothing heavier than a single coin, but it can
write and read. It has [dice] HP and Defense 10, but takes no damage
from bludgeoning weapons. The size of the automaton depends on the dice
you invest in the spell. 1 [dice]: mouse 2 [dice]: dog, 3 [dice]:
person, 4 [dice], elephant.</p>
<p><strong>75. Violently Depilate</strong> R: 50’ T: [dice] creatures D:
permanent</p>
<p>Target creature’s hair flees it’s body in a sudden, painful burst.
The target is stunned for 1 round and takes 1d6 damage. Save negates.
Creatures that prize their hair, such as Orthodox Wizards or Elves, may
need to make a Save vs Fear or a Morale check. The target’s hair will
regrow at the normal rate. This spell has no effect on hairless
creatures or creatures immune to pain.</p>
<p><strong>76. Sturdy Circle in the Air</strong> R: 100’ T: point D:
[sum] minutes</p>
<p>You draw a circle [dice]x5’ in radius in the air. The circle is made
of force, as solid as iron. You can draw the circle at any
orientation.</p>
<p><strong>77. Trifurcate Arms</strong> R: touch T: self D: [sum]
rounds</p>
<p>For the duration of the spell you arms split into three identical
copies, moving independently with all the dexterity and strength of your
normal limbs. You gain +2 to Strength, can carry multiple weapons, and
take a -2 penalty to Wisdom for the purposes of Initiative.</p>
<p><strong>78. Wellingbert’s Obsessive Expertise</strong> R: touch T:
self D: [sum] minutes</p>
<p>Name a Skill. Save, with a +2 bonus for each [dice] you invest past
the first. If you fail, take [dice]+1d6 psychic damage. If you succeed,
gain the chosen Skill with a rating of 8 for the spell’s duration. You
cannot learn things that would not be contained in a well-stocked
library, or skills that are so rare only a few people could teach them
to you.</p>
<p><strong>79. Mirror Item</strong> R: touch T: object D: varies</p>
<p>You touch a non-magical object you could carry without assistance.
The object is mirrored along one axis. Left becomes right. All details
are otherwise preserved. The spell lasts for 1 [dice]: minutes, 2
[dice]: hours, 3 [dice]: days, 4 [dice] months, or permanent.</p>
<p><strong>80. Lock Joints</strong> R: 100’ T: [dice]x2 creatures or
objects D: [dice] rounds</p>
<p>Creatures or objects you target must Save or have their joints locked
at their current angle and position for [dice] rounds. This could affect
the hinges of a door, the links in a chain, or the legs of a sprinting
horse. Stumbling creatures usually take 1d6 damage.</p>
<p><strong>81. Suspend Objects</strong> R: touch T: [sum] objects D:
concentration or 1 minute</p>
<p>Objects that weigh no more than [dice] lbs are suspended in the air.
The slightest effort knocks them to the ground. You do not need to see
the suspended objects, but you do need to maintain concentration to keep
them afloat. If you break concentration, the objects fall in up to one
minute.</p>
<p><strong>82. Hone</strong> R: touch T: object D: permanent</p>
<p>You run your hands over a metal or wooden edge and hone it. The
object becomes razor sharp. Blunt objects deal 1d6 damage. Weapons deal
an extra 1d6 damage for the next [dice]x2 hits. The edge must be smaller
than your outstretched arms.</p>
<p><strong>83. Wernher’s Embafflement</strong> R: 100’ T: creature of
[dice]x2 HD or less D: [sum] varies</p>
<p>A blinking globe of light flies from your hand and sink’s into the
target’s head. The target must Save or become befuddled for the spell’s
duration. The target may attempt a new save at the end of each duration
interval. 1 [dice]: rounds, 2 [dice]: minutes, 3 [dice]: hours, 4 [dice]
days. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, the target also loses 1d6
Intelligence, to a minimum of 1, for the duration of the spell.</p>
<p><strong>84. Ultralucent Paint</strong> R: 50’ T: creature or object
D: [sum] hours</p>
<p>You splatter the target in bright octarine paint, leaving a mark the
size of an apple. The mark is visible through fog, smoke, or total
darkness, at any distance up to [dice] miles. It is also visible through
solid barriers, such as stone walls, up to 10’ thick. The paint drips
off and marks the ground below the target. Unless bandaged or swabbed,
the paint will leave a faint trail behind the target.</p>
<p><strong>85. Lavin’s Pathclearing Servant</strong> R: [dice]x100’ T:
area D: 0</p>
<p>You send an invisible blade of force along a clearly defined path.
Any light debris on the path (snow, small stones, leaves, grass) is
pushed to the side. Any pressure plates or tripwires are activated. You
do not have to be able to see the entire path, but you do need to know
the approximate route the blade will take. The path is [dice]x10’ wide.
If you cast this spell with 3 [dice] or more, the range becomes
[sum]x100’.</p>
<p><strong>86. Battering Beam</strong> R: 100’ T: creature or object D:
concentration.</p>
<p>A beam of force strikes a target you can see, pushing them backwards.
Target must win an opposed Strength test against the beam or be pushed
away from you 10’ per round. Very large creatures only move 5’ per
round. The effective Strength of the beam depends on the dice invested.
1 [die]: 14, 2 [dice]: 16, 3[dice]: 18, 4 [dice] 20. If the target is an
object, treat it as being struck by a blow of equivalent Strength each
round. Each round you maintain concentration adds +1 to the Strength of
this spell, to a maximum of 22 Strength. If the target cannot move
backwards, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per round.</p>
<p><strong>87. Circle of Noise</strong> R: 100’ T: area D: [sum]
rounds</p>
<p>A circle of crackling white light 20’ in radius appears at a point
you designate. Creatures inside the circle must Save or be deafened for
[sum] rounds. If [sum] is greater than 12, they are permanently
deafened. Creatures inside the circle cannot hear anything outside the
circle, and creatures outside the circle cannot hear anything inside the
circle.</p>
<p><strong>88. Ulrich’s Forceful Sigil</strong> R: touch, 50’ T: object
D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>A writhing arcane symbol appears on an object you touch. Any creature
within 100’ of the sigil who looks at it must Save or be pushed back 5’
and knocked prone. The symbol vanishes after [sum] rounds. If you invest
3 [dice] or more, you can instead set the duration of this spell to
permanent, provided no one looks at the sigil. Once it is seen, the
duration becomes to [sum] round as usual.</p>
<p><strong>89. The Automatic Marching Mule</strong> R: touch T: point D:
[sum] hours</p>
<p>You create a mule-like creature out of pure force. The creature has
two bucket-like saddlebags on each side. It walks forward at a brisk
trot. It will stop and turn at your verbal command, but you cannot make
it reverse or slow down. You can only give it the commands “go”, “stop”,
“turn left”, and “turn right”. The mule can carry twice as much as an
ox. It has [dice]x2 HP, and any attacks automatically hit it. It is
completely mindless and extremely literal. The mule will obey your last
command until the spell’s duration expires.</p>
<p><strong>90. Shrikeblast</strong> R: [dice]x10’ cone T: area D: 0</p>
<p>Howling shards of raw magical power fly from your body. The shards
lacerate anything in their path, dealing [sum] piercing damage, Save for
half. If a creature is killed by this spell, it will be suspended in the
position it was killed for [sum] rounds by several embedded shards. A
suspended creature is capable of bearing up to its own body weight in
additional pressure before falling.</p>
<p><strong>91. Sympathetic Resonance</strong> R: touch T: two creatures
or objects D: [sum] minutes</p>
<p>You touch one creature or object and then touch another creature or
object. For the duration of this spell, any spells that affect one
target will have their effects applied to the other target as well. Both
targets must be valid, but range and line of sight between the targets
is not considered. For example, you might touch a goblin and a dragon.
If you strike the goblin with a magic missile, the dragon would be hit
as well, for the same damage, even if the dragon was several hundred
feet away and inside a cave.</p>
<p><strong>92. Cacophony</strong> R: 100’ T: point D: [sum] hours</p>
<p>You send a small orb of force to a point you designate. The spell
creates an incredibly loud clattering, wailing, and whistling when it
detonates. Creatures within [sum]x5’ must Save or be stunned for one
round. It is audible in clear air up to a mile away. You can designate
[dice] conditions under which the orb will detonate. You could say
“now”, “if anyone steps on it” or “if water touches it”. The conditions
must be obvious and must occur within 5’ of the orb. When the spell’s
duration expires, you can choose to have the orb detonate or vanish
silently. The orb is solid, and can be moved or thrown.</p>
<p><strong>93. Alberecht’s Unreliable Disintegrator</strong> R: 100’ T:
object creature of [dice]x2 HD or less D: 0</p>
<p>Target creature, or an object weighing less than [dice]x200lbs,
disintegrates into nothingness. Save +4 negates. Magical objects gain an
additional +2 to their save. You can disintegrate a section of an object
or creature but not very precisely.</p>
<p><strong>94. Squelch</strong> R: [dice]x10’ T: spell D: 0</p>
<p>You can cast this spell as a reaction. You halve the duration,
effects, and/or damage of a spell that would affect you or anything
within [dice]x10’ of you. You cannot affect the spell’s range or area.
If the spell requires a Save, you may instead have any affected targets
gain +4 to their Save. The [sum] of this spell must equal or beat the
[dice]x2 invested in the spell you are attempting to squelch.</p>
<p><strong>95. Everland’s Perfectly Reproduceable Test</strong> R: touch
T: two creatures or objects D: [sum] minutes</p>
<p>You designate two targets. One target acts as the test subject. Any
effects applied to the test subject will be, if conditions are
identical, applied to the other target. For example, if you give a
potion to one target creature, an identical potion given to the other
target creature will have precisely identical effects. The two targets
must be reasonably similar. You could not compare a stone to a mouse,
but you could compare a mouse to a man. If you invest 2 [dice], the
effect lasts for [sum] days. If you invest 3 [dice] or more, the effect
is permanent. If you invest 4 [dice] or more, you may test more esoteric
effects, such as philosophical arguments, love, or fear.</p>
<p><strong>96. Sonorous Seeker</strong> R: [dice]x1 mile T: object D:
[sum] hours</p>
<p>You create a fluttering star of light that twitters like a bird. Name
a unique object you have clearly seen before, and, if the object is
within the spell’s range, the seeker will fly to it at the speed of an
arrow and hover near it, chiming as loud as a bell. The seeker has 1 HP
and a Defense of 16. If the object is not within the spell’s range, the
spell has a 50% chance of seeking out a similar object. Otherwise, it
fails.</p>
<p><strong>97. Dredge</strong> R: 100’ T: area D: 0</p>
<p>Buried or covered objects rise to the surface in area you designate,
[dice]x10’ in radius. If you cast this spell on the ground, coins,
stones, and root will be pulled to the surface. If you cast it on water,
sunken objects will rise to the surface and remain there as long as you
maintain concentration. The total weight of dredged objects cannot
exceed [dice]x100lbs. If you cast this spell targeting creatures in the
area instead, the creatures must Save or be stunned for 1 round. If
[sum] is greater than 12, they also take 1d6 damage and are knocked
prone. Instead of targeting area, you can instead target a single
sentient creature. The creature must Save (if unwilling) or recall a
memory in perfect detail. You designate the memory (“the first time you
met your wife”, “where you buried the treasure”). The creature will be
lost in a reverie for [sum] rounds. This reverie ends if the creature is
attacked, threatened, or has to perform any action. This memory may
induce a Fear or Morale test. It must be specific. “The scariest thing
you have ever seen” would not work, but “the night your village burned”
would.</p>
<p><strong>98. Rolling Spark</strong> R: 10’ T: area D: [sum] rounds</p>
<p>A spark of lightning appears within 10’ of you. Each round, it moves
5’ straight ahead (you designate the original direction). Creatures or
objects in a 10’ radius of the spark (so a 3x3 grid of 5’ squares) take
2d6 lightning damage. Save negates. If the spark strikes a creature or
object directly, or it is struck (Defense 12), the spark will bounce in
a random direction. It may gain speed if struck with significant force.
The spark floats 5’ off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>99. Pyre</strong> R: 100’ T: [sum] creatures or objects D:
0</p>
<p>Targets must Save vs Dex or catch on fire. Targets that are
completely inflammable (soaked creatures, metal, etc.) do not need to
Save. Targets that are very flammable (soaked in oil, dry wood) may not
get a Save. You can target this spell precisely enough to light the wick
of a single candle in a bundle, provided you can see the wick.</p>
<p><strong>100. Cascade of Power</strong> R: touch T: creature D:
[dice]+1 rounds</p>
<p>During this spell’s duration, any [dice] your target expends on other
spells return to their pool on a 1-5, rather than a 1-3. When this
spell’s duration ends, you must Save or suffer a Mishap.</p>

<p>Taken from: <a href="https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/04/osr-100-entities-you-can-summon.html" class="uri">https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/04/osr-100-entities-you-can-summon.html</a></p>
<p>Some cults worship them as gods, intercessors, or oracles. They are
as varied and as wondrous as Creation. Entities have a base Attack
modifier of 0, AC 10 , and 10 HP unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>If an Entity is reduced to 0 HP it vanishes, but it takes no
permanent harm.</p>
<p>The names listed are not their true names. Their true names are very
difficult to write and pronounce.</p>
<p>To summon Entities, Summoners invest Summoning Dice (SD). SD are d6s.
At level 1, a Summoner has 1 SD, and gets a maximum of 4 SD at level 4.
The [sum] of the dice invested, as well as the number of [dice], may
affect the result. Entities are summoned for [sum] hours.</p>
<p><strong>Scrolls of Summoning</strong> Contain a true name and a few
scraps of ritual instruction. If interpreted by a Summoner, the summoner
can permanently call on the Entity. If interpreted by anyone else, the
scroll is one use, cast with 1d4 [dice].</p>
<h2 id="entities-1"><strong>99 Entities</strong></h2>
<p>Roll <strong>1D100</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Melchior, of Eyes Unblinded</strong></p>
<p>Enters from somewhere not observed by the summoner. Appears as a
withered old man in fine robes, or a beautiful young woman with no hair.
In either form, Melchior will mutter constantly, repeating meaningless
phrases or snippets of conversation. As long as Melchior can see the
tongue of a creature, it can tell if the creature is lying. It will hiss
and lunge at anyone who lies for purely selfish reasons, and will seek
to remove their tongue. Melchior will carry items for you and will
provide banal and useless advice if asked. Believed to be one of the
most powerful Entities. Armour as plate, at least 30 HP.</p>
<p><strong>2. Cantopas, the Grey Mirage</strong></p>
<p>Enters and moves like smoke. Appears as a rippling cloud of
grey-white fabric. Sheds light like a candle. An object smaller than an
apple given to Cantopas will vanish. Cantopas moves as quickly as an
arrow (150 miles per hour), and will bring the object to the location or
person you designate, provided it can reach them before vanishing. If it
cannot, it will try and drop the item somewhere along the quickest path.
If Cantopas descends onto the head of a living creature, the creature
must Save or be deafened and blinded for 1 round. Cantopas has 1 HP.</p>
<p><strong>3. Thoriel, who Demands Reverence</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a thunderclap. Appears as two rotating rings of white
light, one inside the other, tumbling through the air. The size of a
clenched fist. Shakes, as if enraged. Speaks in high-pitched monotone.
Up to [dice] times per summon, can demand a single creature it can see
“PRAY”. The creature must make the sign of the Authority or, the next
round, by struck by a 4d6 lightning bolt. Animals of Creation will kneel
or bow instead. Can sense the presence of those who have consciously
rejected the Church within 100’, but cannot sense mindless creatures,
undead, or those who were never converted.</p>
<p><strong>4. Rone, the Blade of Love</strong></p>
<p>Enters silently, in the summoner’s hand. Appears as a black dagger of
stone and grey leather. Cannot speak or see, but can hear very, very
well. Creatures injured by Rone feel no pain, only a curious sensation
of pressure. If you hold it like a pen and use blood as ink, Rone will
write the answers to any questions you ask, provided it has overheard
the answers since you summoned it. It could transcribe a conversation in
perfect detail or tell you how many people entered a room, what they
said, and when they left. If anyone holds Rone against the summoner’s
will, they must Save or take 1d6 damage, and Rone vanishes. If anyone
holds Rone with the summoner’s permission, they must Save. If they fail,
each morning they must Save against the desire to hold Rone again.</p>
<p><strong>5. Gornim, Lord of Vermin</strong></p>
<p>Enters on a cloud of flies and biting insects. Appears as statue of a
child made of clay. Crude. Gluttonous. Can command vermin to move,
assemble, or bring tribute (food). Any other requests are met with
suspicion and peevish demands. If provided with sufficient food (a
larder or storeroom), Gormin will call all vermin within [dice] miles to
him for a grand feast.</p>
<p><strong>6. Malrane, the Scholar’s Aide</strong></p>
<p>Enters from somewhere not observed by the summoner. Appears as a
thin, tired young man or woman with wiry hair. Can speak and translate
any language, living or dead. Will not speak or translate blasphemies,
or prayers to any god but the Authority. Can only offer a literal
translation unless reading by the light of the noonday sun, in which
case, a full allegorical and contextual translation is prepared. Cannot,
or refuses to, write.</p>
<p><strong>7. Esilan, the Keeper of Hours</strong></p>
<p>Enters in a shower of feathers. Appears as a floating hourglass
orbited by wings. Can accurately and precisely measure any time interval
it sees. Up to [dice] times per summon, can demand a single creature it
can see “AGE”. Target creature’s age mirrors for [sum] rounds. A
20-year-old creature becomes 2 years old. A 92-year-old creature becomes
29. A 106 year old dragon becomes 601. This cannot directly cause a
creature to die or suffer any damage, but it may affect HP or stats. If
confronted by blasphemies, glows as bright as a torch.</p>
<p><strong>8. Simpulex, Carnal Bookkeeper</strong></p>
<p>Enters from just behind the summoner. Appears as an androgynous
humanoid wrapped in a silk ribbon. Is extremely beautiful. If Simpulex
touches a creature, it learns the creature’s entire sexual history in
graphic detail. Will attempt to seduce a suitable target it if not
directly observed by the summoner. Uses poetry and flattery. If the
target willingly kisses Simpulex, both the target and Simpulex vanish.
The target never returns.</p>
<p><strong>9. Bantos, Life-Leech</strong></p>
<p>Enters by squirming up from cracks in the ground. Appears as a
smiling man who vaguely resembles the summoner. Creatures touched by
Bantos take 1d4 damage per round. Bantos heals 1d4 HP per round. Bantos
has a Strength of 16 and does not need to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>10. Hisbic, the Coin Counter</strong></p>
<p>Enters in a puff of greasy smoke. Appears as a squashed and twisted
humanoid, with a huge mouth and gut, no neck or eyes, and tiny limbs.
Floats and tumbles through the air like a leaf. Will devour any coins
given to it. Will regurgitate the coins at the summoner’s request, at
any point, even if summoned years later. Loves the taste of rare or
unusual coins. Will only swallow metal coins, not jewelry, shells, or
promissory notes. Can accurately guess the amount of currency a person
is carrying at any given time. Can convert 10 gp per hour from one
currency to another, in any format. Loathes counterfeiters.</p>
<p><strong>11. Raspalan, the Urgent Guide</strong></p>
<p>Enters by running in via a door or window. Appears as a thin human
with a scraggly beard and no clothes other than sandals. Cannot stop
running. Will lead the summoner to any destination they name, provided
it can be reached by running at a breakneck pace and leaping over
obstacles. Will attempt to warn the summoner of traps, monsters, jumps,
spikes, and other hazards in time to allow a Save. If the summoner does
not follow or falls behind, Raspalan will still run to the destination
and then vanish when not observed. If trapped, manacled, or cornered,
will come up with some means of escape that may also benefit the
summoner. Cannot be persuaded to run into a battle, but often runs
through them accidentally.</p>
<p><strong>12. Gemwick, Spell Tutor</strong></p>
<p>Enters in a shower of sparks. Appears as a red humanoid the size of
an acorn. Has a wizard’s robe, hat, and staff. If a wizard sacrifices a
limb or eye (of their choice), Gemwick will either teach them a new
spell or improve (mutate) a spell they already know. Is respectful, but
slightly bored of the summoner. Once per day, can summon 1d6 Limb
Homonculi (as Apes, with 1HP), which are made from the fused limbs and
eyes of wizards he has assisted in the past. The homunculi obey only
Gemwick. Gemwick desires magical items, spells, and the shapely limbs of
wizards.</p>
<p><strong>13. Banzatoul, the Morphing Chain</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a musical clang. Appears as a floating ring of chain the
size of a barrel, spinning slowly. If a living creature passes through
the centre of the chain, it is temporarily randomized. Roll for a random
gender, appearance, and new stats (3d6 in order). The creature’s species
does not change. A creature can only be changed once per day. When
Banzatoul vanishes, the effects end. Arrows fired through Banzatoul have
a 50% chance to catch on fire. Spells with an elemental damage type that
pass completely through Banzatoul on the way to their target have a 50%
chance of changing elemental damage types.</p>
<p><strong>14. Quen, the Truculent Goat</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a clatter of hooves. Appears as a six-legged grey goat.
Attack 14, armour as chain. Loves to charge things. If Quen charges and
hits an enemy of 2 HD or less, the enemy is automatically knocked prone.
Any gate or door less than 20’ tall or wide and not protected by magic
that is charged and hit by Quen bursts open. Quen prefers to charge
targets taller than it, targets with horns, or targets that look
cheerful. If no targets are designated by the summoner, it has a 50%
chance of charging a random target each hour.</p>
<p><strong>15. Fizby, Friend of the Stars</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a faint hiss and crackle. Appears as a tiny blue sphere
the size of a berry. Glows as brightly as a candle. Will move as you
direct and follow people or objects. Each hour it is summoned, there is
a 10% chance a falling star fragment will strike Fizby, or the area
directly above Fizby if not exposed to the sky. Roll 1d6+[dice] for the
type of stone summoned. 1. Tiny fragment of cold stone (no damage). 2-5.
Minor stone fragment, 2d6 bludgeoning damage. 6. Minor iron fragment.
2d6 damage but worth [damage]x5gp to wizards or blacksmiths. 7-8. Major
stone fragment. 4d6 bludgeoning damage, target must Save or be knocked
prone. 9. Major iron fragment. 4d6 damage, target must Save or be
knocked prone, worth [damage]x5gp to wizards or blacksmiths. 10. Star
Core. Everything in a 1 mile radius takes 6d6 fire damage. Everything in
a 100’ radius is obliterated. The star core is the size of a fist and
burns for 2d10 days while slowly evaporating into nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>16. Doron, the Shield of the Righteous</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a small thunderclap. Appears as a round shield of brass
engraved with tightly packed combatants. Can be carried by anyone as a
shield (+1 Defense). If you “sunder” the shield (reducing incoming
damage by 1d12), Doron does not break, but instead reveals one of your
sins or failings to all present in a disgusted tone. It will present
your sins in the least charitable way possible. If you are attacked by
an agent of the Authority (a paladin, an angel, etc.), Doron will still
defend you but will reveal one sin every round.</p>
<p><strong>17. Astokepolos, Diagnosticator</strong></p>
<p>Enters in a stream of leaves and smoke. Appears as a gnarled walking
stick with a serpent wrapped around it. Astokepolos can diagnose one
illness per day, no matter how obscure or complex, and offer a cure.
Roll 1d6+[dice]. 1. Cure is impossible (decapitation), 2-4. Cure is
difficult but possible (the blood of an albino donkey, the tears of a
virtuous raven, a stone from a lost temple), 5-6. Cure is possible to
achieve shortly (a rare local plant, a particular ritual), 7-8. Cure is
trivial (a common plant, a short ritual chant), 9. Cure is instant (a
pressure point, a single word), 10. Cure is instant but the target will
die in 1d6 days, target is not offered a choice. Any creatures cured
with Astokepolos’s advice owe their souls, or a portion of them, to him,
and he will claim them at death unless prevented. He bears no ill will
if prevented provided it is done politely. Astokepolos can also speak to
and translate for serpents.</p>
<p><strong>18. Orniel, the Ash Knight</strong></p>
<p>Enters in a cloud of ash. Appears as a suit of charred plate armour,
stacked neatly on the ground. Any humanoid who puts on the helmet will
be compelled (Save once to immediately remove the helmet) to put on the
rest of the armour. If they succeed, they immediately immolate, and the
Ash Knight is created. The Ash Knight has Attack 14, armour as plate,
and the HP of the person inside the armour. It wields a sword made of
smoke and cinders (d8+2 damage, cannot be parried or blocked by
shields). The creature inside the armour can be faintly heard screaming
as they burn to death. The Ash Knight loses 1 HP per hour, and
disappears when the summon ends. It does not speak, but will obey most
commands without hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>19. Weeblen, Blade Tamer</strong></p>
<p>Enters from somewhere not observed by the summoner. Appears as a
portly man with grey eyes and slightly stained traveling clothes. Can
sharpen any blade. Up to [sum] times per summon, can (a) create a sword,
dagger, arrow, or axe that lasts for the duration of the summon (b)
sharpen a weapon to give it +1 slashing damage until the end of a
combat, (c) identify who forged a blade and when or (d) identify when a
blade was last used. Weeblen will not fight, but will assist with
mundane tasks if given ale or rations.</p>
<p><strong>20. Creston, who Adjudicates</strong></p>
<p>Enters by floating down from above. Appears as a floating stone
sphere the size of a cabbage, carved to resemble a stylized human head.
Speaks in a booming tone. If two objects, items, values, or issues are
presented to Creston, along with a criteria, Creston will judge them.
For example, you could ask “Which of these gems is most valuable?”,
“Which of my friends is most cowardly?” or “Which of these two wines
would I enjoy most?” Creston cannot answer questions that are not local
and immediate. It cannot answer “Which country will win the war?” or
“Which hallway did the King run down?”. Creston enjoys finely made
handicrafts and loathes cheats and pretenders.</p>
<p><strong>21. Jalpirtan, the First Assassin</strong></p>
<p>Enters from the shadows. A thin woman in black and grey, beautiful,
but cold. Speaks in whispers. Once per day, Jalpartian can kill a single
mortal target you name, provided you have a piece of the target’s hair
or flesh, and the target can be reached within the duration of the
summon. Jalpirtan will demand an equal sacrifice: a lord for a lord, a
peasant for a peasant, or the equivalent value in lives, calculated by
some obscure process. Alternatively, she can offer advice in the arts of
poison-making, stealth, burglary, and knife-fighting. If the advice is
simple and the conversation is pleasant, she may not demand a price, but
she might demand the summoner test their new-found knowledge on an
arbitrary target. If the summoner provides her with a suitable
apprentice (a child under 10 with no living family, who has killed at
least one person), Jalpirtan will take the apprentice and provide the
summoner with a detailed plan to locate and kill one mortal target of
the summoner’s choice.</p>
<p><strong>22. Antrac, the Dark Flame</strong></p>
<p>Enters in a flare of fire. Appears as a floating orb of dark red
flame that emits no light. The orb is the size of a horse. Antrac can
imitate any voice it has heard while summoned. It can shrink to the size
of a marble. The flame causes no damage to living creatures or plants
but otherwise burns as a normal fire.</p>
<p><strong>23. Louchan, the Scythe of Bones</strong></p>
<p>Enters silently, in the summoner’s hand. Appears as a scythe of
bones. Can be wielded with two hands (d6 slashing damage). Any creatures
reduced below 0 HP by the scythe have a 50% chance to crumble to dust
and rise as skeletons of appropriate size and HD in 1d6 rounds. The
skeletons last for the duration of the summon, and obey whoever holds
Louchan. Both Louchan and the skeletons it creates instantly crumble to
dust if exposed to sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>24. Sbendis, Helpful Vermin</strong></p>
<p>Enters by burrowing from beneath the earth. Appears as a thin,
flattened, asymetrical crustacean. Speaks in a whistling tone. If you
boil and eat Sbendis (which she readily encourages), the delicious broth
formed by her body can nourish up to 10 creatures for a day. If you
consume her entire body without cooking it, you gain 10 temporary HP for
the duration of the summon. Sbendis can burrow into the body of a
creature that died no more than 1 minute ago and control its body for up
to an hour. She is a very poor mimic and is nearly useless in
combat.</p>
<p><strong>25. Hypanian, the Land-Ship</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a ruble of earth. Appears as a stone ship, crudely
carved, with stone sails and a stone rudder. Can only be summoned in an
area with solid ground. Will move at 2 miles per hour across land,
cutting a furrow that folds behind it. Ignores trees, mountains, hills,
elevation, and lava. Treats rivers and glaciers as reefs and islands.
Ignores wind as well. Can carry up to 10 people or equivalent goods in
moderate discomfort. Hypanian is intelligent and understands commands,
but sometimes forgets to warn passengers of danger.</p>
<p><strong>26. Goamloamer, the Warming Beast</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a shuffle and a pop. Appears as a pig-like creature with
no face. Gloamloamer is twice the size of a horse, moves as slowly as a
person walking, and cannot attack. It has 20 HP, is always hit by melee
attacks, and feels no pain. It is very warm. You cannot eat its flesh,
but if you sleep next to it, you count as being inside a tent. If you
place a healthy egg under Gloamloamer it will hatch in 1/100th the usual
time (5hrs for a chicken’s egg). You can put up to 20 eggs under
Gloamloamer at once.</p>
<p><strong>27. Lukian, the Eye of the Gatekeeper</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a trumpet blast. Appears as a grey glass orb the size of
a marble, flickering with faint shadows. Hovers and faintly chants
hymns. No ghost or demon can willingly come within a 10’ radius of
Lukian. Any invisible ghosts or demons within 30’ are fully revealed in
their true form. Lukian can also tell false priests of the Authority
from true ones.</p>
<p><strong>28. Xeriandel, Whose Form is Agony</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a hideous shrieking noise. Appears as a pulsing rift of
light the size of a clenched fist. Targets looking at Xeriandel must
Save or take 1 damage per round. Even if they Save, targets develop a
splitting headache. Xeriandel will always remain within 20’ of the
summoner, passing through walls and barriers if needed. If not given
instructions every 10 minutes, will slowly drift towards the summoner’s
line of sight. If the summoner falls unconscious with Xeriandel nearby,
Xeriandel will descend into the summoner’s ear and reduce them to
0HP.</p>
<p><strong>29. Jentro, the Mirror of Life</strong></p>
<p>Enters by stepping up from the summoner’s shadow. Appears as an
identical duplicate of summoner, save for some subtle detail, such as
eye colour or a missing scar. Will act as directed for the spell’s
duration, with the summoner’s stats or 10, whichever is higher. Is
intelligent enough to carry out very complex tasks, but has trouble
improvising. Cannot deal damage or cast spells, but can appear to do so
via illusions. The illusions are always minor and short-lived.</p>
<p><strong>30. Kylon, Discord Manifest</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a clatter of stones. Appears as a dusty stone idol the
size of a brick. Up to [sum] times per summon, Kylon can cause two
people to Save or disagree on topic they were discussing. The
disagreement may be resolved, or it may turn to violence. If the dust
from Kylon is rubbed into a book or letter, the text will change to
contain veiled insults and contradictions for the duration of the
summon. Kylon can hear and speak, but prefers to remain smug and
silent.</p>
<p><strong>31. Uziam, the Creeping Death</strong></p>
<p>Enters as a black stain on a surface. The summoner has [sum] minutes
to flee the area. After [sum] minutes, a white figure with tar-like hand
and footprints will crawl from the stained surface. Uziam will stalk and
strangle (Strength 14) any sentient living creatures in the area,
starting with those closest to the summoning point. Serious opposition
will cause Uziam to vanish and select a new target. Uziam can pass
through walls and turn invisible if required. It only targets the
fearful, the isolated, and the weak. Uziam cannot enter areas of direct
sunlight, but it can extinguish non-magical flames at will, provided it
is hunting a target. It will happily hunt and strangle the summoner.</p>
<p><strong>32. Krentos, Knight of Leaves</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a storm of dried leaves. Appears as ancient suit of
animated plate armour with branches growing from the joints. The Knight
of Leaves has Attack 14, armour as plate, and HP equal to the hours of
the day remaining until sunset (18 to 8, depending on the season). At
night, or if not exposed to sunlight in the past 2 hours, the Knight of
Leaves is completely dormant. While active, it will attack any targets
you designate. It does not speak. Dryads and tree-creatures will be
polite to anyone in the company of the Knight of Leaves.</p>
<p><strong>33. Enti, Kite of Eyes</strong></p>
<p>Enters with an accompanying host of winds. Appears as a tattered blue
kite with painted eyes. In a good wind (not provided), Enti will rise up
to 1,000 feet in the air over the course of the summon. While in the
air, anyone holding the other end of Enti’s kite string and spool will
be able to see from Enti’s eyes. You can use this ability at any time
(to peek around corners or under doors, for example), but Enti is
happiest while flying, and may provide insight into the things it sees
while in the air. Anyone holding Enti’s string and spool can cast spells
through its eyes.</p>
<p><strong>34. Ophinania, Rot Butterfly</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a cloud of stinking air. Appears as an ordinary
yellow-grey butterfly. Is invulnerable to harm. Constantly produces an
odour so foul that a) no one within 100’ can eat unless starving b) food
rots or spoils in 1/10th the usual time c) white fabric or paint becomes
discoloured and d) creatures with a sense of smell must Save once to
enter the area, and once again to enter within 10’ of Ophinania. The
summoner is immune to the last effect, but allies are not. The last
effect only applies if creatures are voluntarily approaching Ophinania.
Walking towards a creature does not require them to Save or flee.
Ophinania can tell how long a body has been dead, a flower cut, bread
left since baking, or any other duration related to rot and spoiling.
She will examine up to [sum] items per summon.</p>
<p><strong>35. Banalor, the Light of Creation</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a shimmer of golden light. Appears as floating sphere of
golden flame. The sphere sheds light as a torch. Up to [dice] times per
summon, Banalor can flare and illuminate, briefly, an area 100’ in
radius. Sighted creatures in the area who are not aware of Banalor’s
flare must Save or be blinded for 1d6 rounds. The flare temporarily
cancels magical darkness, which will re-emerge at 10’ per round from its
source. Banalor’s flare does not have the properties of sunlight, but
unholy or unnatural creatures will instinctively flinch from it. Banalor
knows a great deal about scripture, hymns, and glassworking.</p>
<p><strong>36. Irukan, the Tick of Wakefulness</strong></p>
<p>Enters by scuttling out from the summoner’s sleeve or coat. Appears
as blue-white tick the size of a thumb, with three beady black eyes.
Once per summon, Irukan can attach himself to a living target. For the
duration of the summon, the target cannot be fatigued or knocked
unconscious, and does not require sleep for 10 hours after the summon
ends. Irukan will grow gradually more bloated as the summon progresses.
He has 1HP and, if burst, anyone within 10’ must Save or fall asleep (as
per the sleep spell). Irukan does not like being burst, and will give
the summoner nightmares. If Irukan is burst 3 times within a week, he
will lay painful (1 damage) eggs in the summoner’s blood, and in 1d6
weeks a swarm of baby ticks will crawl from the summoner’s tear ducts.
If kept warm and flattered, Irukan can also purify a creature’s blood,
allowing a new Save vs Disease or Poison.</p>
<p><strong>37. Thosban, Cloak of Beasts</strong></p>
<p>Enters by falling into the summoner’s hands. Appears as thick cloak
of mixed furs, crudely sewn. Anyone who puts on the cloak and names a
furred, flesh-eating beast they have personally killed transforms into
that beast for the duration of the summon. They must Save each hour past
the first or let the beast’s nature take hold. They can remove the cloak
at any time, provided they have Saved for the hour. Thosban provides
guttural advice, suggesting mayhem, death, and gorging on flesh.</p>
<p><strong>38. Leticular, Stairway Between Realms</strong></p>
<p>Enters silently, subtly, and nearly invisibly. Appears as a faint
stairway of glass, rising either up or down (randomly determined). The
steps appear to be 1’ high, but in fact raise anyone stepping on them by
1’, 10’, 100’, 1,000’, etc. respectively. By the 5th step up, the air
becomes cold. The 6th step up causes nearly instant death by freezing
cold and lack of air. Similarly, if the staircase, leads down, you can
descend the first 1’, 10’, 100’, and 1000’ safely (though you will
emerge into solid rock unless you step off very carefully). By the 5th
step, the air is intolerably warm. Any further, and you are either
incinerated by the heat or dragged from the stairs by the guardians of
Hell. You can step off the stair at any time, and if you carefully judge
your step, emerge at a useful height.</p>
<p><strong>39. Zantaliar, Lord of War</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a stiff march. Appears as a scowling man in heavy robes.
Will consult and advise on any matters of military strategy, from the
raiding of a camp to the invasion of a continent. His advice is useful
to amateurs but redundant and irritating to experts or those unwilling
to grasp the realities of war. He will refuse to assist in tomb-robbing,
burglary, or other unsavory acts. His advice is no more than a year
behind the cutting edge of the area or conflict he is examining.
Zantaliar will not fight for you, and will occasionally shout advice to
your enemies if they seem particularly disorganized.</p>
<p><strong>40. Oswing, the Merchant of Delight</strong></p>
<p>Enters from somewhere unseen by the summoner. Appears as a thin
grey-skinned man or woman in a pale blue cloak. Up to [sum] times per
summon, can touch a willing living creature to transport them to a
rapturous ecstasy that lasts [dice]+1d6 hours. Only pain can wake them
from their vision. Oswing will demand payment for the visions. At first,
the payment will be trivial, but it will quickly escalate to outrageous
sums, cruel tasks, or impossible items. The weak-willed, the desperate,
or the poetic must Save after the first vision or forever desire
another. Oswing will not give you a share of its payments, but will
allow the Summoner to enjoy a 1hr vision, per summon, for free. If paid
or flattered, it can tell you what visions its clients enjoyed best.</p>
<p><strong>41. Iescophcos, Arrowhead of Sorrow</strong></p>
<p>Enters in the summoner’s pocket or boot. Appears as black stone
arrowhead, shiny like glass. If placed on a horizontal surface, the
arrowhead will rotate to point at the nearest newborn person, no matter
the distance. Newborn, in this case, means within thee days of birth. If
Iescophcos is brought within 10’ of a newborn, it begins to shake. If
plunged into a newborn’s heart, two effects will occur: the child’s
heart will forever beat at a steady, slow pace, and on their sixteenth
birthday, they will be compelled to seek out and obey (as a permanent
charm person spell) whoever held the arrowhead at the time they were
wounded. The infant is not otherwise harmed. If attached to an arrow,
the arrow deals 1d6+[sum] damage on a successful hit, but the summon
immediately ends. Iescophcos speaks a language no one can
understand.</p>
<p><strong>2. Antoban, the Harbinger of Winter</strong></p>
<p>Enters in a storm of freezing air, from a nearby door or window.
Appears as a pale white humanoid of the same species and gender as the
summoner, but stiff and frozen like a frostbitten corpse. An area 100’
in radius around Antoban will always be uncomfortably cold. An area 10’
in radius around Antoban will, provided Antoban is not moving, become
painfully cold (1d4 cold damage per round, unless creatures are well
insulated or immune to arctic temperatures). Antoban takes half damage
from all weapons and spells, but double damage from fire. It can discuss
the history of winters in the area, focusing on famine, madness, and
murder wherever possible. Ice elementals fear and revere Antoban, but it
will not command them for any reason. In battle, it wields a short iron
sword (1d6 damage).</p>
<p><strong>43. Noroyo, the Useless Fish</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a loud plop. Appears as a horse-sized fish with green
scales and whiskers. Sits quietly, slowly breathing and looking around.
Despite being out of the water, will not die. Noroyo’s flesh is edible
but tastes foul and vanishes at the end of the summon, possibly with
disastrous effects. If summoned in water, Noroyo appears as a stunted
pony with short limbs, and swiftly sinks. The main use of Noroyo is
summoning it in the air to squash your enemies (inflicting 3d6
bludgeoning damage on a typical summon, Save vs Dex negates).</p>
<p><strong>44. Uskip, Protector of the Virtuous</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a ringing sound. Appears as a purple disc of light,
floating 2’ over the summoner’s head. Any objects falling on the
summoner from above, no matter how heavy, are instantly stopped by the
disc. If trapped by a rockfall or avalanche, Uskip will shield the
summoner and create a small air space around their body. This will not
help the summoner escape, but will prevent them from being crushed or
immediately suffocated. Additionally, for the duration of the summon,
the summoner gains a +2 to Save vs Magic. Uskip vanishes if the summoner
utters any blasphemies or strikes a priest.</p>
<p><strong>45. Warlence, the Perpetual Relative</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a shuffle. Appears as a peasant in appropriate local
dress, with a rucksack full of rags and rotten onions. Up to [dice]
times per summon, Warlence can designate a target who is not aware
Warlence is an unnatural creature. The target will treat Warlence as a
distant relative. At a minimum, this will involve a simple meal
(Warlence is ravenous) and a warm bed for one night. Warlence is happy
to go along with any deceptions the summoner suggests, but cannot invent
lies on its own. Will carry supplies and assist with other simple
activities, but will not fight for you.</p>
<p><strong>46. Loswach, the Universal Chisel</strong></p>
<p>Enters in the summoner’s hand. Appears as an iron chisel with a
wooden handle. Loswach can separate any two layers. You can use it too
separate skin from muscle, gold foil from wood, rust from iron, or bark
from a tree. You can’t separate things that are not fused, so Loswach
couldn’t chisel the armour off a warrior or the nose off a statue (at
least, not any more than a normal chisel could). In combat, Loswach
counts as a dagger. Loswach cannot speak, but it will carve answers to
simple questions into stone, if guided by an idle hand.</p>
<p><strong>47. Benlib, Door of Possibilities</strong></p>
<p>Enters on a nearby wall. Appears as an ordinary wooden door. Will
allow [sum] creatures plus the summoner to pass through it, once per
summon, and walk through any other door the summoner has seen and marked
with a tiny symbol. The door must be within [dice] miles, and must not
be locked or magically protected. Benlib vanishes after [sum] creatures
or spells have passed through it. Non-living objects pass through Benlib
normally, appearing at the door the summoner designated.</p>
<p><strong>48. Nauox, Tapestry of Lies</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a thump and cloud of dust. Appears as a rolled up
tapestry, 6’ by 10’, with ornate designs featuring scenes from the
summoner’s life as well as fictional scenes. All of them are slightly
embarrassing to the summoner, but this is only noticeable on very close
examination. Nauox can speak and insists it is a flying carpet. It is
not. It also insists it can crush anyone wrapped in it. This is also a
lie. The tapestry is animated, and can walk (very slowly) on its
corners. Though it will claim otherwise, it cannot be harmed by acid,
fire, or spells. A solid hit from an arrow or spell will knock it
over.</p>
<p><strong>49. Eb, the Tasting Lizard</strong></p>
<p>Enters around the summoner’s neck. Appears as a sleek yellow lizard
with a bright blue tongue. Eb can taste poison gas on the air, and
provide information about the source of odours, smoke, or fog. Eb always
knows the local tides, and will tell you which hour in the day will be
most propitious for sailing, fishing, or conceiving children. Eb desires
warm stones.</p>
<p><strong>50. Yigmarial, the Soul Cache</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a glimmer of light. Appears as a tiny grey cloth effigy
of the summoner, with strange wet-looking eyes. For the duration of the
summon, the summoner automatically passes all Saves vs Death.
Decapitation or extreme bodily harm will still kill the summoner, but
almost everything else will merely knock them unconscious. The effigy
has 1HP and, if torn, burnt, or damaged, immediately requires the
summoner to Save vs Death, which is not automatically passed (of
course).</p>
<p><strong>51. Rix, Bisector</strong></p>
<p>Enters in a shower of gold light. Appears as an old man with a long
golden beard and a pair of comically oversized gold scissors. Rix will
cackle and snip [dice] creatures objects in half, then vanish. Objects
are not harmed in any way and will remain bisected for the duration of
the summon. When the summon ends, the halves join back together, no
matter the distance or implausibility. Both halves function
independently. Halves of creatures have 1/2 the HP of the original.
Creatures or objects can be as large as a castle.</p>
<p><strong>52. Dave</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a leaden thump, a brief fall, and a short scream. Appears
as a bedraggled teenage human with brown hair and a dull brown robe.
Dave was once a wizard’s apprentice. A botched spell trapped him in a
pocket dimension. Dave lives on, immortal, invulnerable, and extremely
confused. He is perpetually being dragged into combat, danger,
dismemberment, and extremely awkward situations. Dave will sort-of obey
you for the duration of the summon, but he is only an immortal teenager.
He’s awful at everything. Dave only lasts for [sum] minutes instead of
[sum] hours. If you summon Dave with 3 or more [dice], Dave’s efforts
are accompanied by appropriately dismal music.</p>
<p><strong>53. Clippet, Lord of Ducks</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a regal quack. Appears as a white duck with a golden
crown. Clippet can command all ducks (with reasonable success). He
desires bread, tribute, flattery, and clean water to splash in. Up to
[dice] times per summon (but at least once), Clippet will engage someone
in conversation. Anyone speaking with Clippet must Save each hour or
continue speaking. They can take other actions, but are distracted and
possibly dismayed by the duck’s fascinating wordplay. If he is well
flattered, the summoner may be able to direct him to speak with specific
targets. Otherwise, he will just pick interesting people at random.</p>
<p><strong>54. Cerein, The Sword of Strange Girdles</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a triumphant orchestral roar in the summoner’s
outstretched hand. Appears as an amazing enchanted sword. Its pommel is
a crown. Its blade is mirror bright and covered in strange runes. Its
hilt is two dragons devouring each other. The sword appears with [dice]
other supernatural effects (flames, clouds of rose petals, lightning,
etc.) and mythical connections appropriate to the era and location. It
is a perfectly ordinary sword and deals 1d6 non-magical damage. The
summoner cannot drop the sword. If spun or left to drift, Cerein can
tell true kings and knights from false ones.</p>
<p><strong>55. Elorham, Wand of Repulsion</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a moist pop in the summoner’s hand. Appears as a thin
wand of willow wood covered in scowling faces. Constantly fires a 30’
stream of egg-like projectiles that weigh as much as a scrap of paper.
The projectiles deal no damage. They could fill three 10’x10’x10’ cubes
per hour. They could slowly knock a candlestick off a table. A creature
struck by the full stream must Save with a +8 bonus. If it fails, it
cannot move towards the wand’s wielder this round.</p>
<p><strong>56. Pentornax, Traitor’s Friend</strong></p>
<p>Enters silently with a slight drop in temperature. Appears as a faint
humanoid shadow on a wall. Up to [dice] times per summon, Pentornax can
step away from the wall and strike a creature with a concealed shadow
dagger, dealing [dice]x2d6 damage. Creatures targeted must be friends of
the summoner or have pledged loyalty to the summoner. Pentornax only
betrays. Dogs can sense Pentornax but must Save vs Fear to approach it.
Pentornax does not speak but it does obey commands, no matter how
complex. It can move as fast as an arrow.</p>
<p><strong>57. Fasin-Gelth, the Zone of Madness</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a shimmer. Appears as a faint outline around [dice]x10’
cubes, visible only to the summoner and owls. Anyone inside Fasin-Gelth
cannot see out or affect the outside world. Instead, they see to a
featureless white plain and a cloudless white sky. Creatures outside
Fasin-Gelth can see and affect creatures inside. Creatures can pass in
and out freely, but Fasin-Gelth will disorient them and Stun them for 1
round. Sighted and mobile creatures who spend more than 10 minutes
inside Fasin-Gelth take 1 Wisdom damage every 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>58. Nessalor, Cloudlight</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a soft glimmer of light. Appears as a floating sphere of
fine white hair lit from within. The size of a person’s head. Moves as
if underwater. Casts light as a candle. Up to [dice] times per summon,
Nessalor can fill a 40’ radius with dense fog. Alternatively, it can
suck in and absorb a 40’ radius of fog or smoke. Nessalor has 1 HP and,
if struck, bursts and fills a 40’ radius with fog (as above).</p>
<p><strong>59. Yorax, Avian Sommelier</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a polite cough just behind the summoner. Appears as an
elderly raven the size of a man. Yorax can shrink to the size of a wren,
but prefers to maintain its full (impressive) size. It can determine the
vintage, quality, and market value of any wine by tasting it and write a
short review on a scrap of parchment using one immaculately sharpened
claw. If provided with a bottle of wine worth at least 50gp, or 50 fresh
eyeballs, Yorax will also set one object (not creature) on fire for you,
provided the target can be reached within the duration of the summon and
set on fire with a torch. Yorax will not fight for you, but it might be
persuaded to carry you out of danger.</p>
<p><strong>60. Fensington, the Consolation of Conscience</strong></p>
<p>Enter with a shuffle. Appears as a middle-aged, bland, faintly
concerned human. Further descriptions are impossible; Fensington’s
appearance evades memory. Fensington’s voice is low and soothing.
Fensington will assist anyone in justifying any behavior, plan, or
crime. People who engage Fensington in conversation must Save or be
calmed and freed from guilt or doubt. Fensington has no secret knowledge
but may hint vaguely at schemes, accusations, religious authority, etc.
Fensington will not fight for you, but any arrows or projectiles aimed
at Fensington or anyone within 10’ automatically miss.</p>
<p><strong>61. Burchub, Bringer of Infatuation.</strong></p>
<p>Enters from above in a shower of rose petals. Appears as a portly
baby with dove’s wings, a bow, and a quiver full of sickly pink arrows.
Burchub will fly around giggling and poking things. He will shoot
[dice]x2 targets, always in pairs, per summon. Each pair is must Save
(once per pair, chose the highest Save) or fall in deep, romantic love
for the duration of the summon (or possibly beyond it). Nothing
physical, just bad poetry, longing gazes, shy conversation, and
capital-F-Feelings. Burchub’s bow has a 60’ range and hits on a
19-in-20. On a critical miss, the shot strikes an adjacent creature or
object. Burchub will also open any mundane lock provided it separates
two people.</p>
<p><strong>62. Pultrudia, Worm of Worry</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a moist plop on the summoner’s shoulder. Appears as an
earthworm with a scowling face. Pultrudia induces anxiety. Anyone within
100’ is mildly worried. Anyone within 10’ is extremely concerned,
paranoid, and doubtful. Anyone holding Pultrudia, or allowing her to
nestle against their neck (her favourite spot), is immune to all
mind-altering effects and cannot be surprised. They also immediately
assume the worst in any given situation and cannot relax, sleep, or
enjoy idle pleasures. Up to [dice] times per summon, Pultrudia can sing
a horrible piping song that causes milk to curdle, leaves to fall from
trees, and fruit to rot within 300’.</p>
<p><strong>63. Robolotanobar, The Un-Cursed Sphere</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a thunderclap. Appears as a bright red orb the size of an
apple. Casts light as a candle. Makes a quiet but ominous keening, like
someone using a bandsaw in a distant room. Robolotanobar will follow a
target you designate for the duration of the summon, steadily drawing
nearer and nearer. Its speed increases to match the target but with a
few moments of lag time. It cannot be blocked, dispelled, diverted,
tricked, or avoided. It will touch the target just before the summon
ends. Nothing happens.</p>
<p><strong>64. Kwis Bizmac, Swift Sustenance</strong></p>
<p>Enters with the patter of running feet. Appears as a scruffy-looking
person in an off-white, stained, and ragged uniform. Kwis Bizmac will
hand the summoner a package containing [dice] rations, bow politely, and
run off. The rations are bizarre and inconsistent. They are usually
warm, highly spiced, and very salty. Seafood, strange cured meats, sweet
sauces, unusual vegetables. The rations have all normal effects, but
also completely remove hunger for the duration of the summon. Any items
handed to Kwis Bizmac will be returned (contemptuously) the next time it
is summoned as if no time has passed.</p>
<p><strong>65. Lisnan, Solemn Guardian</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a warp and ripple of flesh. Appears as a bulky, ogre-like
humanoid with blue flesh and no head. Its face, small and crude and
cruel, is sunk into its chest. Lisnan has a Strength of 16 and will
carry things or lift heavy objects. Up to [dice] times per summon,
Lisnan will roar, pose, or glower, forcing a reroll on a Morale check or
a Reaction roll. This can be positive (your hirelings are encouraged by
the giant blue enforcer) or negative (the goblins are dismayed) or
confusing (the king isn’t sure who you are but rethinks his position).
Lisnan will not fight for you, but will block people attacking you with
precise whip-fast blows, granting you +2 Defense. Lisnan wants to drop
beautiful and expensive things from a very great height and watch them
smash.</p>
<p><strong>66. Orlinhorn, the Tree of Slumber</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a draft of warm air. Appears as an acorn in the
summoner’s hand. The acorn will sprout into a sapling in 2 rounds, then
grow into a 100’ tall, 50’ wide oak tree in 10 minutes. The oak will
grow straight upwards from wherever the acorn was planted. It has an
effective Strength of 20 when it comes to smashing walls, lifting
objects, and pushing upwards. It will bend to avoid very strong
obstacles. Its trunk is grey and its leaves are green and silver. Any
water that touches the leaves becomes a sleeping draught. If ingested,
Save or sleep for 1d6 hours or until the summon ends. If you can speak
with trees, Orlinhorn will tell you everything its roots and leaves
touch. Orlinhorn disappears when the summon ends.</p>
<p><strong>67. Melwax, Protocherub</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a moist plop. Appears as a ball of flesh 3” in diameter
with a wet and toothless mouth. Screams and cries like an infant. Melwax
has 1 HP, but can only be damaged by the summoner. It can be eaten to
provide 1 ration. It can be thrown (as a dagger). If you summon Melwax
with 2 or more [dice], it has tiny arms with grabbing hands. If thrown,
it will stick to whatever it hits and remain their for the duration of
the summon. If you summon Melwax with 4 or more [dice], it also grows
tiny wings and will fly around screaming, pulling on peoples hair, and
throwing a tantrum. You can feed Melwax a few drops of a potion to
determine the effects.</p>
<p><strong>68. Iplimble, She Who Denounces</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a roar and a shouted accusation, 10-[sum] hours after the
summon is initiated. Appears as a middle-aged woman of a suitable race
and appearance for the area and situation. Iplimble will denounce the
summoner in general terms (Coward! Thief! Adulterer! Poisoner!) and drag
the summoner away. Iplimble’s appearance may be enough to convince
guards or authority figures of her right to take the summoner prisoner.
If that fails, she can produce false documents, seals, food, and even
bribes. She will drag the summoner out of sight and then vanish. Her
Strength is 18. She will not rescue anyone else, return for dropped
equipment, or heal the summoner . No barriers, magical or otherwise, can
hinder Iplimble, but she will only take the summoner to the next
unlocked and unobserved area.</p>
<p><strong>69. Bhors, Fire Crane</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a flash of orange light. Appears as a human-sized bird
with long legs, a long sharp beak, and feathers made of flame. Bhors
casts light as a torch. It will attack any frogs or fishes it sees
without hesitation. It can be bribed (with fishes, frogs, or flattery)
to attack other targets. Its beak deals 1d6 piercing + 1d4 fire damage.
It can speak, but it isn’t very clever, and mostly wants to talk about
eating small wriggling things.</p>
<p><strong>70. Gundobart, Vision-Keeper</strong></p>
<p>Enters by hopping. Appears as a fat green toad the size of a
housecat. Surly yellow eyes, many warts. Gundobart speaks with a hoarse,
deep voice. Anyone who licks Gundobart must Save or vividly hallucinate
for [dice] hours. Gundobart does not particularly enjoy being licked.
Objects swallowed by Gundobart effectively cease to exist for the
duration of the summon. He spits them back out before he vanishes. He
will only swallow things that look delicious but he is easily
tricked.</p>
<p><strong>71. Knorlian, Beast Trapper</strong></p>
<p>Enters from somewhere not observed by the summoner. Appears as an old
man wearing a heap of furs. Carries a large iron cage. Up to [dice]
times per summon, Knorlian will try to stuff a single creature into the
cage. An aware and unwilling creature gets a Save with a bonus equal to
its HD. Somehow, no matter the size, the creature fits inside the cage,
though they may look compressed and unhappy. They remain in the cage for
the duration of the summon. Knorlian will not drop the cage, throw it
into danger, or allow people to attack creatures inside it. Knorlian can
also track any creature by footprints, smell, or signs. He will also
lecture for [dice] hours on a trapped creature’s habits, biology,
weaknesses, dietary needs, and unusual characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>72. Xrim, He Who Desecrates</strong></p>
<p>Enters as a pool of blood. The summoner has [sum] minutes to flee the
area. After [sum] minutes, an alligator-like beast made of bone and
congealing blood will emerge from the pool. Xrim will try to destroy any
artwork, carvings, decoration, or written works it can see. It has 30
HP, Attack 12, armour as chain, and very good eyesight. It will not
attack any living creatures (unless they are decorated) except for the
summoner, who it particularly loathes. It is intelligent enough to use
fire, sabotage, and threats to destroy artwork, and will progress from
area to area smashing things and wreaking havoc until the summon
ends.</p>
<p><strong>73. M’tubana, the Wobbling Stone</strong></p>
<p>Enters in the summoner’s hand. Appears as a stone idol of a round,
stylized, humanoid figure with a cheerful grin. Anyone holding M’tubana
cannot be knocked prone, pushed, or tripped. If you would fall into a
pit or off a cliff, M’tubana wobbles you back to safety at the last
possible moment. It won’t help if the building collapses, your airship
explodes, your broomstick fails, etc. If you are about to be hit by an
attack, there is a 50% chance M’tubana flings you 10’ in a random
direction before the attack hits. Additionally, any soups made with
M’tubana in the pot are never poisonous or toxic.</p>
<p><strong>74. Postidon-Pru, the Telescope Worm</strong></p>
<p>Enters by falling from the ceiling in a heap. Appears as a white
rope, 30’ long, with a lamprey-like mouth at both end. The mouths can be
stuck to any surface. Postidon-Pru can be stretched an additional
[dice]x100’. Just before the summon ends, Postidon-Pru will contract to
5’ long. It has an effective strength of 20. If properly coiled, it can
lift heavy objects, crush people, or pull two things closer together. If
Postidon-Pru’s two mouths are connected together, it contracts
immediately and the summon ends. If the both mouths are not stuck to a
surface, small objects (coins or smaller) placed in one end appear at
the other end in 1 hour.</p>
<p><strong>75. Malofin, Cursed Instigator</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a low whistle. Appears as a stick-thin monkey-like figure
in ragged blue robes. Has a huge toothy grin and tiny red eyes. Up to
[dice] times per summon, Malofin will taunt a target you designate.
Malofin’s taunts, capers, jeers, gestures, and wails are extremely
distracting. Targets must Save or attack Malofin first. If they were
previously neutral or friendly, they may need to Save or become hostile.
Malofin is extremely annoying. It has armour as plate. It will run away
from any fight to taunt again from a safe distance. Malofin can also
climb and perform simple tasks with a monkey’s patience and skill.</p>
<p><strong>76. Soriel, Monstrous Bat</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a flap of leathery wings. Appears as a mouse-sized bat
with eight spider legs, three red eyes, and a fanged drooling mouth.
Anyone who sees Soriel must Save or believe Soriel is gigantic, at least
elephant sized, possibly larger if outdoors at night. Any inconsistent
movements are explained away as “a near miss” or “unnaturally folding
itself”. Soriel likes to frighten people, but will apologize if anyone
starts crying or screaming. Its voice sounds like glass being crushed,
so apologies rarely help. Soriel can speak to bats and spiders and will
translate for you.</p>
<p><strong>77. Moriana, whose Word is Peace</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a polite knock on a door or a quiet shuffle. Appears as
an old woman in very clean black traveling clothes. Carries an empty
scabbard but no sword. Once per summon, Moriana will read a story for
[dice] hours. In order to begin the area must be relatively quiet and at
least one sentient creature must be present. While reading, no violent
actions can take place within 100’. Non-sentient creatures will quietly
wait at the edge of the circle. Sentient creatures (including the
summoner) who can hear must Save or sit down somewhere convenient to
listen. If they pass, they can move freely, Anyone making a noise louder
than a dropped coin will cause Moriana to shush them. Shushed creatures
are affected by the sleep and hold person spells for the duration of the
story. They can still hear Moriana speak. Moriana appreciates
well-crafted books and well-told stories. She speaks and reads all
languages, but won’t read tales without artistic or moral merit.</p>
<p><strong>78. Wilinspat, Chest of Torment</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a loud crash. Appears as a plain wooden chest large
enough to contain a person. Screams quietly when opened. Flickering red
light comes from within. If a creature is placed inside Wilinspat, both
it and the chest vanish for the duration of the summon. A creature
inside Wilinspat loses 1 HP and 1 Wisdom (to a minimum of 1) for each
hour they spend in the chest. At the end of the summon, Wilinspat
returns, disgorges its passenger, then vanishes. Creatures remember
nothing of their experience, but are feverish, nervous, and prone to
nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>79. Grenchan, Roving Limb</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a wet thud. Appears as a blue-green arm and hand. If the
shoulder is attached to a person (it sticks to skin), Grenchan will act
as an extra limb. On a willing person, it grants +1 attack per round. It
can wield any one-handed weapon, carry a shield or a lantern, or assist
with climbing. If attached to an unwilling creature, Grenchan will punch
them in the nearest vulnerable spot, dealing 1d4 damage per round.
Grenchan has a Strength of 14 for punching or removal purposes. If
detached, it can be stuck to [dice] additional creatures per summon.</p>
<p><strong>80. Ieducomer, Cauldron of Uniformity</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a clatter of iron. Appears as an iron cauldron with five
clawed feet. Ieducomer is just large enough to contain a curled-up
person. Up to [dice] times per summon, if completely filled (use water
or sand to fill in the gaps), Ieducomer will grumble, grind, and mix
everything inside it into a perfectly uniform slurry. It will then dump
this slurry on the ground unless specifically instructed not to. One
person can ride inside Ieducomer, but it only travels at a walking
pace.</p>
<p><strong>81. Vorgar, Death’s Harbinger</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a sudden drop in temperature and a cold shudder. Appears
as a deformed, eyeless skeleton in ragged black robes. Vorgar is visible
only to the summoner, creatures near death (0 HP or below), and wizards.
Once per summon, Vorgar can remove [dice] fatal wounds from a dying
creature, or add [dice] fatal wounds to a creature at 0 HP or below.
Undead creatures cannot willingly approach within 30’ of Vorgar. If a
creature has evaded death through unnatural means, Vorgar will fight
them. Attack 15, defense as plate, 20 HP, 1d8+2 damage and 1 level
drained on a hit. The summoner has 1/2 HP for the duration of the
summon.</p>
<p><strong>82. Barlinfort, Spirit of Delight</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a poof of magic sparks. Appears as a tiny glowing
humanoid the size of an apple. Barlinfort constantly makes a noise like
quiet silver bells. It can fly and speak in a high-pitched whine.
Barlinfort will sprinkle glowing dust on up to [dice] creatures. The
creatures will fly for the duration of the summon provided the
constantly compliment Barlinfort. If they stop complimenting Barlinfort,
they will begin to sink. If they insult Barlinfort they will fall.
Barlinfort has 1 HP and no sense of shame or irony. If bored, it will
cast light as a candle, fly around the summoner’s head, nest in their
hair, pick flowers, or chatter inanely.</p>
<p><strong>83. Caperlin, Avatar of Debauchery</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a cheerful roar and a drunken hug. Appears as a portly
monk with brown robes, a tankard full of beer, and a rosy complexion.
Caperlin is absolutely smashed and very cheerful. Unless provided with a
party (at minimum, snacks and two happy people), Caperlin will fall
asleep in [dice] hours. If a party is provided he will continue to drink
from his ever-full tankard, tell wild tales, propose mad schemes, sing
songs in all languages, give very solemn yet very shallow advice, and
occasionally vomit. He cheers up any low-class social event and
scandalizes anyone tasteful. Caperlin can locate up to [dice] things per
summon, provided they are party related and can be reached within the
duration of the summon. Examples: more beer, a safe place to crash, a
person of negotiable virtue, musicians.</p>
<p><strong>84. Subansu, the Rose of Luck</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a shimmer in the summoner’s hand. Appears as a red rose
with a silver stem. Anyone wearing Subansu above their heart gains
+[dice] to their Save and may reroll up to [dice] d20 rolls for the
duration of the summon. If a random effect would target one person in a
group of people, someone wearing Subansu is not selected. Subansu
induces confidence. Anyone wearing it must Save vs. Wisdom when
presented with a risky but thrilling plan or accept it. If Subansu is
stabbed into the heart of a dying person, that person remains alive for
the duration of the summon. They gain no other benefit.</p>
<p><strong>85. Yingilnip, the Three Fingers of Regret</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a cold swirl of air. Appears as a withered three-fingered
hand and wrist lying on a convenient surface. Yingilnip grants wishes.
Bend a finger back and speak a wish and Yingilnip will grant it. Effects
last only for the duration of the summon. Yingilnip will twist wishes in
every possible malicious way, including ignoring the original phrasing.
Wish for gold and a huge block falls on your head. Wish to be a king and
get kidnapped by political conspirators. Wish for a friend to come back
to life and they rise as a revenant. With to travel to a distant city
and Yingilnip flings you through the air or drags you through the earth.
Etc. You may be able to convince someone to use Yingilnip. You probably
won’t be able to convince them to use it twice.</p>
<p><strong>86. Ootremak, Unquiet Spirit</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a rolling fog. Appears as a swarm of tiny ghosts, nothing
more than an acorn-sized head and a faint trail of vapour. There are
[sum] ghosts. One vanishes each hour. A single ghost can push a sheet of
paper, rustle a curtain, or roll a coin along the ground. They can
barely coordinate their efforts. Any number of Ootremak’s spirits can
possess dying or mentally shattered creatures of [dice]x2 HD or less for
the duration of the summon, controlling them until the summon ends. They
are monumentally stupid and easily distracted.</p>
<p><strong>87. Murlspeth, Slaughtercaller</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a sizzle in the summoner’s hand. Appears as a red stone
the size of an apple, carved to resemble a snarling tiger biting its own
tail. All damage dealt within a 30’ radius of Murlspeth is doubled. If
Murlspeth is thrown (as a dagger) or dropped it returns to the
summoner’s hand in one round. Murlspeth is warm enough to melt wax. It
growls just before ambushes.</p>
<p><strong>88. Koilcren, who is Lost</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a polite shuffle. Appears as ragged and tired middle-aged
man or woman with bright blue eyes. Anyone who engages Koilcren in
conversation must Save or give them directions to a location Koilcren
names. The summoner can designate up to [dice] locations at the time of
the summon. Directions given will be to the best of the target’s
knowledge, and may include the location of locked doors and keys, traps,
hazards, patrols, supernatural effects, etc. Ask a peasant how to get to
the moon and he’ll shrug and suggest a mountain. Ask the Grand Archmage
of the College of Elderstone and you might get a very different answer.
Koilcren will not fight for you, and will watch with disinterest if a
fight occurs.</p>
<p><strong>89. Joolsorel, the Ravenous Maw</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a rumble and grind. Appears as a 2’ wide ring of bone and
teeth floating in the air. Anything that touches Joolsorel takes 1d6
damage per round. It moves at a slow walking pace. The summoner can
designate a point and Joolsorel will move directly towards it, chewing
everything in the way. You can define [dice] points in the route (so 1
is a straight line, 2 is an L-bend or a patrol, 3 is a triangular
patrol, etc.). Joolsorel will slowly chew through wood but will just
noisily grind against stone and metal. Soft objects thrown into
Joolsorel are immediately shredded.</p>
<p><strong>90. Koskalbanodan, First Among Horses</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a clatter of hooves. Appears as an ordinary-looking but
very tidy grey mare. Koskalbanodan can speak to horses and will
translate contemptuously. She will not fight for you. She will permit
one person to ride her, but will travel at a slow trot unless racing
another creature. She will win all races over any terrain, no matter how
terrifying or improbable. The race can be to a destination or to
exhaustion. If you invest 3 or more [dice], Koskalbanodan will consider
racing inanimate objects, spells, the weather, etc.</p>
<p><strong>91. Narthiel, the Sight that Binds</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a thunderclap. Appears as a floating white eye with a
pupil of black fire. Up to [dice] times per summon, time stops in a 30’
cone in front of Narthiel for [sum] rounds. Anything that moves into the
cone gets sucked in and freezes on the edge. Living creatures partially
struck by the cone, or creatures that move into the cone, take 1d4
damage. While stopping time, Narthiel cannot move. Narthiel’s sight also
reveals any invisible creatures and illusions in a 30’ cone.</p>
<p><strong>92. Alifane, the Hat of Marvels</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a brief burst of light on a person’s head within 100’ of
the summoner. Appears as a magnificent hat, crown, turban, etc.
appropriate to the wearer’s desired social status and Alifane’s whimsy.
Wearing Alifane grants +2 to Defense. Spells specifically targeting
Alifane’s wearer have a 25% chance to fail. Alifane can hear the
wearer’s thoughts. It despises murderous intentions or cruel behavior
and will shout warnings (in a nasal, peeved voice) to anyone the wearer
is thinking of attacking. It will also judge fashion shows or evaluate
the worth of clothing.</p>
<p><strong>93. Quis-Quispon, Immaculate Draughtsman</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a polite cough. Appears as a young man in very fine
clothing. If provided with suitable materials and a work surface
(anything from paper and a pencil to blood and a stone floor will do),
Quis-Quispon will accurately and meticulously draw anything it can see.
It takes 1hr for a basic sketch, 5hrs for a detailed drawing, and 10hrs
for a drawing that resembles life itself, frozen. Quis-Quispon’s
drawings are worth at least 10gp per hour invested. Anyone who views
them and Saves vs Intelligence can discern hidden allegorical meanings
and hints. Quis-Quispon will not fight for you and will try to seduce
any nearby beautiful people. He hates distractions, wind, birds, and
coarse things. He will offer mocking etiquette lessons.</p>
<p><strong>94. Prokiglov, Master of the Dance</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a merry burst of music. Appears as a person in red robes.
Age and appearance vary, Prokiglov’s expression and clothing rarely do.
Prokiglov will play casual but refined music on any instrument provided.
One per summon, Prokiglov will draw its own instrument (varies) and play
a tune. Everyone within 200’ must Save or be compelled to dance. They
can still move normally, but some actions may be difficult. If combat
occurs during the dance, any odd numbered attack rolls succeed or fail
as normal, but any even-numbered attack rolls automatically fail. All
participants have a pool of points equal to their Dexterity that they
can use to modify rolls by +1 or -1. Prokiglov cannot abide disobedient
or noisy children, cats, and lavender.</p>
<p><strong>95. Husbap, Sea-Speaker</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a moist slap and a smell of seawater. Appears as a
cat-sized purple octopus. Husbap can speak with any body of water larger
than a cup. Husbap’s touch inflicts 1d6 poison and 1d6 electrical
damage, but Husbap moves very slowly on land and does not like being
thrown around, attached to weapons, or put in danger. It will shock the
summoner if it feels threatened. It can fit through 2” wide gaps and
report on what it sees, though it tends to exaggerate. Up to [dice]
times per summon, Husbap can emit a horrible keening noise as loud as a
church bell. No one knows why.</p>
<p><strong>96. Krepsobar, the Laddermaker</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a shuffle and a polite greeting. Appears as a disheveled
middle-aged man in brown overalls. Carries a tool belt and a very large
canvas bag. Up to [dice] times per summon, Krepsobar can pull a wooden
ladder from his bag that reaches between to points the summoner can see.
This might be convenient (up a cliff, across a chasm), improbable
(through a portal, to the bottom of a river) or mythological (to the
sun). The ladders created are only made of wood and vanish when the
summon ends. They will not fall on their own but they can be broken.
Krepsobar will also offer advice on carpentry, map-making, and,
incongruously, dark sorcery.</p>
<p><strong>97. Valsbur, the Throne of Power</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a trumpet blast. Appears as a chipped wooden throne with
eight wooden legs. All the gold has been chipped off, taking most of the
red paint with it. Anyone sitting in the throne can project their voice
clearly up to 200’. They are also immune to all mind-altering effects.
Halsbur moves at a slow walking pace. If threatened with fire, Halsbur
can run as fast as a horse, though it will try and toss anyone sitting
on it into water.</p>
<p><strong>98. Bowoworth, Primordial Slime</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a sulphrous burbling. Appears as a grey goo boiling up
from the ground, filling [sum] 10’ squares to a depth of 1’. Bowoworth
will very slowly digest plant and animal matter. It has effectively
unlimited HP but deals no damage. Anyone moving through Bowoworth must
Save vs Dexterity or fall prone. If ingested by a creature, Bowoworth
reverts them one evolutionary step (elves become humans, humans become
apes, lizardmen become lizards, etc.) for [dice]x10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>99. Yeltran, Bearer of the Cups of Haste</strong></p>
<p>Enters with a billow of steam. Appears as a silver tray with six
spindly silver legs. Carries [dice] cups of a miraculous liquid. Anyone
who drinks the liquid acts twice per round for 1d6 minutes. They are
jittery, excitable, and unable to focus. Yeltran will follow the
summoner, acting as a mobile tray or carrying light burdens. Any poisons
poured into Yeltran’s cups have a 50% chance of being neutralized. If
they are not neutralized, the poisons become doubly effective.</p>
<p><strong>100.</strong></p>
<p>There are only 99 entities in all creation. If a 100 is rolled, roll
again twice and allow the summoner to select an Entity based on the name
only.</p>
